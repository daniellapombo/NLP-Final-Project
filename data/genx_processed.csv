1,"> i tried to sneak in a lyric from california into my phd dissertation lol.

lol, thank you. this is the best thing i've heard all day."
2,"i remember how everyone raved about lollapalooza that year. i didn't make it until the 4th one (beastie boys, smashing pumpkins, nick cave, flaming lips, the verve, guided by voices, green day, luscious jackson). 

nirvana was supposed to headline but kurt killed himself instead."

12,"man, in that first pic it looks like the cabin is really precariously balanced on the boards on top of saw horses. the boards end perfectly where the bottom of the cabin goes by. 

i thought there was another set of sawhorses on the other side and the cabin was 3' off the ground."

this is actually not a joke. it's a good job which is pretty fun and easy and there are mistake pizzas every night you can take home to the family."

17,5 points without the village idiot isn't 5 points. this would be horrible.
18,dessert? if you're doing a brazilian steakhouse right you should be in a coma by the time dessert rolls around.
19,"there used to be a little storage center hidden back by the railroad tracks catty corner to the soccer field where the old water tower is (was). i haven't been there in ages. i think that all of that is torn down now. but it's too bad because for decades it was a kind of hidden usc landmark - the place where all the shitty bands had practice, and therefore a great place for casual parties to spontaneously happen (in non-pandemic situations of course). the code to get in was 1234 and everyone knew that.  

i'm almost certain it's gone now but that's still a good way to do it if you can scrounge up the money to pay for a unit. not sure how great the accoustics are in a space that small but most storage places are used to college aged bands practicing there during the day or early evening and don't care. go with a independent place rather than one of the big chain places as they are always a lot looser with the rules.

another option is just to do it in public like at a park. no one ever goes to maxcy gregg it seems like. or you could sit out on the sidewalk in 5 points and put your case out and maybe make a few dollars doing it."

29,no worries. i was just making a joke.
30,"thanks for this. it seems to be reddit taking up almost all of that space. i used the ""clear data"" option to clear up a ton of space."
31,i don't think so. does res do that? most of the data seemed to be from reddit - 19gb worth.
32,wow thanks for introducing me to a new term. i kind of knew this phenomenon existed but googling it taught me something.
33,"i had a friend who worked in a porn store in the 90's, back when they had the booths in the back for people to watch videos in because it was before the internet was popular and didn't really have video yet. he had to put the tapes in the vcr and start them playing, and there were monitors for each one so he could see if they were playing right - like if the tracking was fucked up or whatever. 

he hated it. mainly because most of the people afraid to watch porn in their own home were gay men watching gay porn. 

he was also supposed to clean the booths, but just refused to do it. i went back there one time to see it and got about 1 foot inside the door, and noped out. it was creepy af and nasty af."
34,well this turned into the shittiest ama ever. dude didn't answer a single question.
35,"eh. i keep digging through porn until i find a video with the correct amount and quality of ass spanking latex wearing lesbian redheads. 

the struggle is real. what we need is a better porn search engine. every sight has some shitty system that relies on keywords or something so that whoever uploads the video can just lie."
36,this is mildly disturbing.
37,they need to be working on that elsagate shit before they worry about closed captioning imo.
38,"wait. you're saying that the dialogue on a video has to have the words printed over the video so that a program can read the words? 

why not just listen to the original video?!!!"

40,"it's so weird when you see your friends' computers and you know it's their jerkin location. it's not a big deal, we all do it. but it's just weird when you see their gaming chair or whatever they sit in and you know 100% that's where they blow their load."
41,"holy shit, it's actually not rick astley this time. 

the one time i saw it coming and i was wrong."
42,we should start a porn company that intentionally takes typical porn plots as far into absurdity as possible.
43,it can be sexy to think of other people fucking their siblings because of the taboo. thinking about fucking your own sibling is not sexy at all.
44,"> just precautionary labeling.

which sucks because now people see that label on everything and disregard it, meaning it doesn't do it's job on things that are *actually* dangerous."
45,this thread is quickly becoming /r/unethicallifeprotips material

54,"toxic masculinity refers to men who do stuff like rape and sexually harass, i believe. people are allowed to complain about their rights being violated like that. 

women get plenty of gendered but only for women advice on how to be attractive to men. there is an entire magazine industry dedicated to it. 

this really just seems like you are bending over backwards to create a victim narrative for yourself."
55,i have noticed that the women on the left are far better looking than the women on the right. it's very consistent with the conspiracy theory.
56,globe salesmen. they'd go out of business if the truth leaked. they are an extremely powerful lobbying group.

67,"my dumb ass was thinking ""man, for a deaf guy he really is jamming to that music!"" and then it dawned on me..."
68,"college students obviously don't tip well but they do give you bong hits. there was a house with a hot tub where some gay guys lived and they were in the hot tub most nights when they ordered food. often naked. they tipped really well. always invited us in. i never took them up, though one of my co-workers did. gay guys in general were some of the best customers - always very fun, having parties and stuff, always really friendly and tipped well. 

i did have women come to the door in lingerie and invite me in, but they were never the women you'd want to be doing that, lol. 

there are people like what i think these strip club delivery customers are like - folks with a lot of money they could just drop on anything and like being catered to. so for example this one guy was a big construction contractor on a job for the university we were near. the first time he ordered he introduced himself and called a couple more times that night. he had a woman over and would order one small item from the menu to get delivered and ask to talk to me personally, and request that i pick him up a case of beer or some smokes or whatever and bring those too - and he'd give me a $20 tip in addition to paying me back. so me and a couple other drivers got on pretty good terms with that guy and he'd call almost every night with these ""extras"" but we loved it because he was so generous (and a pretty fun/laid back dude). turns out the woman was just his in town mistress while he was on the job, his wife was back home. it became a real issue when they finished the construction job and he went back home. the mistress started stalking him and showing up at his house and threatening the wife, etc. and a couple of us got subpoenas from the mistress to go testify in a court case about it because we'd witnessed them staying together at the apartment he was living in while on the job (the place we delivered to). she lost, it was actually a pretty stupid case, i don't even recall what the actual lawsuit was about. she was basically just angry that he broke up with her and had been using her just as his temp side piece while on the job and wanted to hurt him legally, i think. 

wasn't all fun and games, though. one of the other drivers was mugged. he was walking up to a house and a man came up behind him with a garrote and wrapped it around his neck and threatened to cut his head off if he didn't get the money. he got the money. driver drove back to the shop and quit on the spot. i got into a couple very minor car accidents like scraping someone's bumper pulling out of a tight parking spot, and got a couple of tickets for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or something dumb like that, but never had anything really bad happen like getting mugged. though i was sure after that friend got mugged to never keep my tips from the night on me, and to stash them back at the store in between deliveries. 

i worked for a short while at a papa john's in a different area, and the manager there gave all police free pizza. which meant that the delivery drivers there always got a warning and never a ticket. i wish the first place had that set up! 

it was one of the best and most fun jobs i ever had. it is barely like working, and the money was actually fantastic. this was back in the 90's and the clinton economy was doing great - better imo than it's ever been since. but i'd work a shift on a typical thursday night and make $150 in tips on top of minimum wage base pay plus a certain amount for mileage (for gas and wear and tear on the car - which really was an issue because you drive so much and it's all stop and go, hard on the car). but i was a college student and had roommates so my weekly paycheck was just enough to cover my bills like rent and utilities, meaning that all of that cash was mine to do with what i liked for the most part. i, of course, blew most of it like a dummy. 

oh, i nearly forgot. this was in columbia, sc, by the university, in the 90's like i said. which brings me to a group who was some of our best tippers of all - hootie and the blowfish. they had just gotten famous (and rich) but still lived in a party house right by campus. i wasn't a big fan of their music but they were very cool guys and having just become multi-millioniares they definitely tipped well!

it's a really neat job, and other than the things like wearing out your car a bit it has very few downsides. i do think location and what kind of restaurant you work for makes a difference though. being by the university meant we had a lot of fun/cool/cute customers, and that was an indie shop and they tend to have more interesting customers than some chain place like the papa john's i worked at later."
69,"i believe subs like that are often created by angry people who want to make others look bad - in this case anti-feminists who want to make feminists look insane. i know there are a ton of screenshots of social media posts that are pretty obviously these kind of astroturfer sabotage attempts floating around reddit. someone makes a fake account that appears to be a feminist or liberal or trump supporter or whatever they hate, then they say the worst things they could imagine the object of their hate saying, screenshot it, upload to one of the many reddit subs dedicated to hating on that particular demographic, and then watch everyone rage at the imaginary person. sadly there seem to be people dedicated to doing this with their time."

71,well there are different ways. but one is wait until a night the moon is at the right brightness to get the sand exposure time the same as the time needed for the sky exposure. another is to use a black card in front of the camera lens to dodge the sand or sky - whichever is too bright.
72,"it looked this way when i was there. other than being blue, like i said."
73,yeah the color is way too cold for some reason but there are ways to get the sand and the sky exposed this way in the same shot.
74,"there is no reason to think this. the sand won't change no matter how long the exposure, because it's not moving. water goes smooth because it's moving while the shutter is open. 

it's entirely possible to make a shot like this without photoshopping anything."
75,"it's 100% possible to make this shot with no editing, as long as that spot actually exists without any plants or anything in there. i believe it's just moonlit with a long-ish exposure at a high iso and a wide angle lens."
76,they do if you make a long exposure.
77,what? it looks exactly like this other than the color in the photo is very cool (blue).
78,"> someone who was abused may show none of the above

very, very unlikely."
79,"most people who weren't abused won't fit all 7 things though, while most people who were emotionally abused will. these are all pretty accurate for people who have suffered abuse, even if some people who haven't been abused also fit."
80,more like a andy.
81,your mom taught me that lesson.
82,"how are people so desperate to see scantily clad women that they'll actually pay $30 extra for food just to get it delivered by strippers? how do people have $30 for 2 minutes worth of looking when you don't even get to see them naked? 

i don't understand this world and what people spend money on. if i did i guess i'd be making enough money to pay strippers to bring me chicken fingers."
83,good word.
84,you just described my college dorm.
85,i mean no one expected we'd all be going on 4 month vacations this year.
86,perky titties make great perks.
87,does the coronavirus come free with that or is there a fee?
88,"yep. we had a full nude strip club that ordered food a lot and we'd fight for who got to deliver it for multiple reasons. 

it's so wild to have the naked stripper tipping *you*. and since we were similar aged and the guys who come into strip clubs (especially during the day) are often not super charming, the strippers liked us a lot and flirted with us. it was fantastic.

also hospitals were great deliveries, because the whole floor would all get together and make an order that just took one delivery, but every doctor and nurse threw in a dollar tip, so you'd get like a $30 tip for just taking the one delivery up to that floor."

95,"it's not really darwinism because young people survive covid19 pretty well. but they'll return home and spread it to older people.

96,lol gen x really is the forgotten generation. thank goodness we're safe because literally no one cares about us or talks about us at all.
97,"i miss the time when we all went out all the time because that was the only way to meet people. now dating has become far too much like ordering off of a menu, except that the filet has to swipe right on you as well, so half the time you feel like you're just settling for anyone who will bother to look beyond your poorly taken photos from 3 years ago."
98,"if you're attracted to them how much does it matter? 

serious question, not sarcasm. as a straight guy it would kill me to be attracted to a woman to find out she was actually just a very feminine man. i wouldn't even consider it. i assume it's the same for gay people, but i'm not gay so i can only ask."

also the last array isn’t ambience or an actual boss but that’s my favorite. more boss than ambience. 

and i couldn’t pick out any one boss tune in d2 like those."
214,"last wish armor can drop with the taken barrier mod, which is helpful in a bunch of places. i’m still doing the free chest exploit."
215,winning is a relief at best.
216,"> this creates a sick sense of urgency that i must get to at least three wins or else any effort i put forward to trials all weekend was quite literally for nothing.

i play this game every day and have half of the crucible pinnacle weapons but i’ll never play any pvp quest or mode again that requires wins for loot. nothing in the game is worth that frustration in my life."
218,no more “thank you”s for medical professionals huh?
219,is that the rosewood neck and headstock with the engraved fender logo?
221,losing that “event” feel is certainly an unfortunate byproduct of the new armor design then.
222,"i did like seeing everybody dressed up for
iron banner. it made it feel like more of an event."
223,how about a black hello kitty strat to match?
224,hmm
225,man i love the vault of glass.
226,"requiring wins to complete the quest is much worse, and that’s how it was in d1."
227,i used antiope and recluse.
228,"i hear you, but i also completed the quest in like three hours. it’s one of the easiest iron banner quests ever, and much easier than in d1 where wins were required to get the max level drop."
229,"you heard him guys, stay home to blunt and peak."
230,in the world i see ...
231,he should shave his head bald and go full lex luthor.
232,"as a casual i just want something. anything i ever got in trials became this precious thing, even the basic emblems and blindsight boots. even the trials weapons i got doing (non-expiring) quartermaster bounties in patrol. [edit: crucible]

let the flawless guys have glowing prizes or whatever, but don’t leave the rest of us empty handed."
233,"> every game he loses, he reports them as a cheater.

i don’t even know who were talking about but that’s a guy who needs to take a break."
234,"trials of the nine was great as a casual. i still
had to communicate, i still had a chance to win, and i could use any weapon i wanted. i went into trials with a thistle and yew scout rifle and came out with the prosecutor!"
235,"i would die over and over for a good few kills every once in a while and trials gear drops at the end of matches. until then, i have way better ways to spend my time."
236,and now you know ... the *rest* of the story 😄
237,ok. that makes more sense. well ... if it drops again i’ll give it a shot.
238,"really? i have winged sun, blindsight, and lion’s vigil armor on my d1 hunter right now."
239,"big no on crimson, that got me my luna’s, but yes on trinity ghoul. can’t figure that one out."
240,"i’ve got a true prophecy with drop mag and timed payload - if it had explosive payload instead, i’d masterwork it."
241,i’ve tried to love that gun for a while ... maybe you two will get along better!
242,i’m really interested in this build too! i’m loaded up.
243,"> how would i straighten my wrist

the simple answer is “don’t bend your wrist.” easier said than done. 

wrap your thumb around the top of the neck if you can, that helps me play with a straight wrist. maybe your fingers aren’t able to do this, so you can cheat a little. 

play power chords with your index and pinky only - pinky frets then 5 and octave. don’t play with one finger on each note. 

play e form barre chords using the a-e strings only. 

basically if you have to hold your wrist like that to play it, rearrange something. either rearrange your fingers or transpose the chord if possible."
244,mij 👍
245,"ah ok, i’m not at max artifact. i’ll keep an eye out for that when i level up. good that they have a way to complete events or level up faster the more you play, they usually do."
246,"going back to destiny 1, 140 hand cannons are my default weapon.  would love a buff. and more 140s with explosive payload!"
247,the new systems really confuse me. how to i get warmind cells?
248,what is a skydock lls?
249,"i’d happily accept a buff to luna’s. it’s fun in pve and i love the weapon model, but i can’t make it work in pvp."
250,it would be super cool to see old gear with the new shaders.
251,i’ll add that prs ses are probably the finest guitars you can find under $500. i dare you to find negative reviews on quality or playability. some people like other tones or styles more.
252,"on the internet, no one knows you’re a giant dog."
253,but why male models?
254,you are under no obligation to fill your life with people like that. and you are under no obligation to consume or enjoy his music. and you are under no obligation to “separate the art from the artist.” you can like or dislike music for any reason whatsoever.
255,sure. sounds like a backdoor pilot opportunity. good luck!
256,i wouldn’t recommend loading any resume up with that. communication and organization skills can be proven in the resume itself. the next three are too vague to use. focus on quantified accomplishments instead.
258,try the gunmetal marigold shader!
259,"one thing that’s improved since year one is that cores are plentiful, so you can pull a decent year one weapon out and for ten cores, masterwork it and make it better and more useful. so give it a shot!"
260,there you go. i was going for luna’s and got recluse by accident. nice surprise!
261,"honestly i don’t even use the seasonal mods. it’s more than i’m interested in tracking, i don’t have the time to manage that on top of everything else, and i don’t want to sacrifice reload and targeting mods for things i don’t understand. 

those and the overload nonsense are a bridge too far. i’d rather just have new gear and story missions."
262,wow. there is still stuff i haven’t found there. those and some of the hidden bones. what a great level.
263,is the the cme mustang??
264,striker or hammer bro?
265,reality used to be a friend of mine.
266,"i knew a girl who said she did that. freed the dog from being chained up outside in the summer. i didn’t argue with her about it, and that’s when i realized that just because people don’t contradict me, it doesn’t mean i’m right."
267,"getting elected to any position is an accomplishment. put it on your resume!

- elected to executive leadership position, 2020-2021 school year, rock and roll high school"
268,i thought i had just loaded into the tower.
269,"any nylon strings fulfilled by a local shop, because amazon has a 4-week delay on some stuff right now. 

you could also call a local shop and ask how to order online. if it’s just one guy i bet he’d answer the phone."
270,stratiligo.
271,ok thanks i’ll check it out
272,it’s right up there with abc and the best pop songs from motown or the beatles. roland orzabal is one of the best pop songwriters of all time.
273,i guess you can tune a fish!
274,"keep your wrist straight! and if it’s too hard to play, transpose it."
275,thanks! i’m content to stay in the dark about all that.
276,"i don’t understand any of that either, but i appreciate the reply. 😁"
277,a buff? you mean from those alarm towers?
278,it’s not that bad. the real trouble is that it has to be done before any token drops. and i’m not doing it again in another character.
279,it definitely does happen. lots of non-crucible clans or randoms group up for iron banner. a six-stack doesn’t mean victory.
280,yup. had a buddy get zero quest or bounty progress in a match.
281,"from that perspective, people have been complaining about iron banner since the obama administration."
282,what does that mean
283,"you’d think one generation after the internet, this would change."
284,sounds like a good combo. also sounds better than getting stomped. as soon as i have this new bow i’ll try it out.
285,"maybe, but i don’t have either. i don’t think most players do."
286,yeah but i tossed most cassettes years ago. i did keep the smells like teen spirit cassingle.
288,"the only things i need for my strat are a stand, strap, cable, pick, and one of those little tuners. i believe you can get all of these fender-branded, if that's what you are looking for."
289,age of triumph was three years of a game and all expansions at the same time. d2 was a new game well aware of power and fashion creep. there had to be less stuff.
290,shoot to loot! great perk for those strike boss hidey-holes.
291,"disagree. i have some of the armor and ornaments, and they made me feel cool for a while, and it’s been long enough, and everybody should get a shot at them."
292,it was ok in year one ... in comparison.
293,"that’s how it used to be! in d1 you could get a whole set of armor from just losing, as post-match drops. wasn’t as cool as the stuff you got from wins, but it was *trials* stuff."
294,any quest is better than one that requires iron banner wins.
295,no hiring manager will care about that. don’t use a template builder. just use plain text. or fill up the space.
296,i remember when people used to actually drive. i’d trade texting and slow drifting into my lane around for some good old cassette tape-fueled road rage and tailgating any day.
297,i blame paul mccartney. plenty of country guys sing in an actual typical male register.
298,well i meant the opening of crota’s end - and i think i might try that again soon. i dipped back into d1 again today and it felt pretty good.
299,did they all get arrested right after getting haircuts?
300,is this when hot topic happened? brought commercialized “punk rock” to the masses?
301,"i've got a cupboard with cans of food

314,“the crow” soundtrack!
315,mythbusters episode?
316,"i felt like sookie and eric had zero chemistry (especially during the sex scenes), and alexander skarsgard can have chemistry with an old shoe. so, i never truly “bought into” the sookie/eric storyline."
317,westgate in austintown
319,"yes, i have. it confirmed my theory. ;)

it also reminded me of the early video from thor 1 where he was training with mjölnir."
320,"i had a feeling that he was growing his hair long specifically for this. natural, gorgeous, tom hair vs. bad wig. just like the first thor movie."
321,lucifer!

324,the soundtrack is amazing. one of my favorites of all time. pure peter gabriel genius.
325,"professor here. i make it a point to not require a book for my classes. 1. because i know how ridiculously expensive textbooks are.  2. i don’t use one primary source for the content.  3. i hand grade everything myself - no ta to help me.  4. i’m not lazy, entitled or privileged.  5. sometimes i can be an asshole. in general, not necessarily to my students."
326,"that’s a fair statement, but i appreciate that character’s “arc.” the prosecutor that you initially dislike, turning into the prosecutor that you end up rooting for. i also appreciated the series leveraging a past character (original og daddy stone). it felt like they were rewarding the long-term fans."
327,"i think there would be more love for stone if he had been on longer. we only got him for two seasons, right?i love barba and cabot, but believe there was a lot of potential for stone."
328,"yes, every time i dream about being in a relationship with tom hiddleston. seriously."
329,"i was born in 1969, and turned 50 last year. so..."
330,alice in chains!

342,"i agree completely, and you stated it very well. i’m currently a university professor, so i’m personally dealing with several struggling students every semester, who are drowning in debt because they didn’t realize, or weren’t educated/told about all of their available options post high school."
343,oh crap! you are so right! getting my shakespeares confused.  🤦🏼‍♀️
344,"if you have documentation from urgent care, i would give you an extension."
345,what about michael fassbender’s version?
346,"i can understand that, i was taught the same thing, as were both of my brothers who ended up in the trades. they both ended up making more money, and having a better overall “package” than i did as a vp in a fortune 500 company. 

so, what’s keeping everyone from entering the trades now? you come out of college with a ton of debt and no job prospects, trades are still not a viable option?"
347,"why does everyone think going to college is the answer? the future is in the trades. it’s skilled labor, and there will always be a demand for plumbers, electricians, mechanics, etc. also, no school loans."
348,that’s a easily justified week-long holiday to me.
349,at least your students are citing!
350,valid point.

355,"not saying it doesn’t, it’s just a real contrast to the other characters"
356,"she’s all about asking for “forgiveness” instead of “permission,” which is fine if she had earned that. reminds me a bit of stabler. how he always thought he knew better than everyone else."

358,betrayal on broadway
359,"he may have had some feelings, but those weren’t going to get in the way of his reaching his goals."
360,i think metropolis was only interested in the minuteman having enough credibility and interest from the press to push his/their own initiatives - sponsorship and making money. he’s an opportunist.

368,right! hot priest!
369,"yep, a quick call to dean winchester!"
370,"he was really great on the show. i wish he had gotten more credit for his portrayal. when hoyt asked to be glamoured and not remember jason at all, the look on jason’s face was heartbreaking."

372,"i loved those books. also, her mayfair witches series."
373,i loved penny dreadful. but i hated how it ended.

391,"he wasn’t mortal, but godric’s death was painful. the way that he “saw” himself after 2000 years with no hope of redemption in the future was heartbreaking. i wish the story would have had him stay around and attempt to atone for his past by doing “good works” or something. it could have been a great contrast to how eric and pam saw/treated humans in relation to themselves."
392,"i wish he had stayed on the show longer. his dynamic with eric was so interesting, and it could have led to some great storytelling and acting opportunities for alexander skarsgard."
393,"i think with sookie specifically, there was an exchange of blood. eric and bill both had her’s, and she their’s. 

as far as other people doing v, i would assume they have sexualized dreams about the vampire whose blood they drank, maybe it just isn’t mentioned, discussed or shown.

and in regard to vampires being able to sense emotions and locate those that have drank their blood, i’m sure they can (as eric and bill can for sookie). but who’s to say those vampires weren’t drained completely and died the “true death,” or that they aren’t being used as a blood bag somewhere and in no condition to sort through all of the v user’s emotions, or that they aren’t capable of “turning it off” or to “mute?”"

402,"i think it was more like pop-punk with bands like green day and blink-182.

old-school punk...misfits, ramones, sex pistols, bad brains, dead kennedys...those days were over.  but people influenced by those bands...very much still around.

i was into thrash metal and punk.  mostly thrash.  so the music of the 80's and 90s has a special place for me."
403,"nta.

i can't imagine even me as a kid having anything but sympathy to another kid who lost their mother...even if the neighborhood bully lost his mom, i'd have some sympathy.

404,sooo much better than wyatt earp.
405,"you will not defeat that squirrel.  the only thing i've seen defeat a squirrel in the wild are the bird feeders that spin them off...and that seems cruel to some.

i watched my father battle squirrels around the birdfeeder the better part of 15 years.  he'd come up with something clever, the squirrel would defeat it.  my dad (an engineer by trade) would come up with a new countermeasure...the squirrel would defeat it.

finally, my dad was ready to declare victory after seeing his latest anti-squirrel defense of the birdfeeder when it stopped multiple attacks from the squirrels.

but victory was short-lived.  2 days later, my mom and i were lucky enough to have watched it happen.  another squirrel, probably the brains of the operation,  slid down the blocker on his stomach while holding on with his hind legs... but instead of falling off, he reached under the lip at the end and flipped himself around like some sort of trapeze artist.  he turned and with one paw grabbed the feeder and ended up setting on the bird perch...calmly eating birdseed. 

my father didn't believe it until a few days later when my mother and i presented him with the photos of the squirrels masterful attack and of the squirrel eating on the birdfeeder.  my father...with a look of sadness and a hint of anger, finally admitted defeat at the hands of the squirrel."

413,"i don't think stupid really explains it.  sure, we all see pictures of the stereotypical  trump supporters and say, ""yeah, they're idiots.""  we can also think, ""yeah, who the fuck would support trump after all this?""

i think there's a couple additional factors in play.  we're in a time of crisis, so right or wrong, citizens will rally around their leader.  if it was a competent leader in the crisis, i'm betting the approval ratings would be much higher.

the second factor is the intelligent voters that voted for trump probably did so holding their noses...because if you're a republican, anyone in the gop is preferable to anyone in the democratic party (and vice versa).  it's not entirely logical but politics are riddled with emotion."
414,"yeah, i always look at well-performed magic like it's performance art.  even if you know how the trick is done, a good magician will be so smooth you'll never see how they're doing it.  now, i (and probably everyone else here)  know he's palming the bandanas, but he was so damn smooth, you'd never see it."

best advice i can give is take roles that will expand your skills...don't be afraid to try something new in it.  be comfortable being uncomfortable.  you'll find something that eventually really excites you and you'll stick with that for some time...but don't get married to it...the market changes too quickly.

427,"true.

i had a bmw m240i that i sold in december (i was driving less than 5k miles a year).  the other reason i sold it is that it was fairly low to the ground and it was difficult for me to get in and out of between my bad back and bad left knee...not to mention i'm in my 50's.  i had to sit and spin to get in and out of the car.  

still, best car i've ever owned."
428,"i've been in the business for 23 years and still love it.

430,"i don't get it.  my neighbor has a tree that just on her side of the property.  she asked if i liked the tree and i said i did.  she was asking because she was thinking of cutting it down (i like the shade it provides).  

5 years later it's still standing.

conversely, we had 2 trees that were just on my other neighbor's property.  i asked that neighbor if i could trim some huge branches back as the tree was leaning over on that side.  they said no problem.

point is, it's not that hard to get along with people...even if you only talk to them a few times a year."
431,the same government that insisted on making their own tests for covid-19 and then waited a month to *allow* private industry to do so?
432,nobody is forcing you to do it.
433,"again, you're parroting the same info without looking deeper into the data.

""for 81 percent of first-generation hispanic immigrants, a bigger government is more desirable. for the second generation, the preference drops to 72 percent. by the third generation, only 58 percent prefer bigger government."""
434,"apparently, you need to look into the numbers a bit more.  that number falls with each subsequent generation.

""for 81 percent of first-generation hispanic immigrants, a bigger government is more desirable. for the second generation, the preference drops to 72 percent. by the third generation, only 58 percent prefer bigger government.""

this doesn't help your argument."
435,"it's a bit easier when you get to a senior-level and you've established yourself as someone that gets things done, cleans up messes, etc.  if anyone brings me in and expect me to just push buttons (which is unlikely at my pay range) then they're wasting their time.

also, i would have sniffed some of those problems out in the interview.  when i'm on an interview, i interview prospective employers as much as they've interviewed me.  i've passed on gigs where i wasn't comfortable with the person i'd be reporting to or where they were at in terms of their environment.

so what kind of things did i ask?  i ask what are their pain points?  what major projects do they have upcoming?  what is the current architecture?  is the architecture documented?  i'd bring samples of my documentation and scripting.  i look up the people i'm interviewing with on linkedin.  

so how did i get to a senior-level and have a reputation for getting things done?  by doing exactly what i said above.  but the real trick (that i didn't learn until i was about 12 years into my career), is that it isn't about being cautious, it's more about being  political.  

the worst thing you can do is cut someone else's idea or work down.  you need to sell others on the benefits of your solution.  sell your peers, sell your management, sell the stakeholders and make a business-case.  that is how you get ahead and get things done.  if you can learn to do that...not only is life easier, you'll get much further ahead."
436,"of course, you never want to act like you know better...that's why you need to ask questions as to why something was done a particular way.  it's also why you need to get buy-in from peers and stakeholders before proposing a change."
437,"the point i was making is that you're deluding yourself if you think the reason that government continues to grow is immigration.  or if you think that there's a ""better"" side....when the gop is just as authoritarian as the democrats.

the bottom line is being anti-immigration is not a sound argument for smaller government.  if you want smaller government, you need to convince far more than immigrants why smaller government is preferable.   voting for one authoritarian over another is not going to get you there."
438,"accepting the line ""we've always done it this way.""  you're coming in with fresh eyes.  in those first few months, take notes on what you think you can improve upon.

you need to ask why something is done in a particular way.  sometimes your predecessor will be sharp, will have good documentation and have solid processes and architecture in place.  but there's always room for improvement.  challenge the status quo.

look for ways to improve existing processes or architecture.  make a business case for how and why you want to make the changes and get buy-in from stakeholders.

that's how you increase your value to the company and on your resume.  every job you take is an opportunity to grow your skills and pad your resume.  don't let it slip away on 'we've always done things this way."""

450,"my son's activity has gone up dramatically.  he doesn't have cable, nor does he have any other streaming service.  since he's been laid off both his jobs (he worked at a gym and as a bouncer...just recently found a job), he has tons of time.  the other 3 external users have seen a modest uptick in usage.

myself and my stepdaughter have been pretty consistent with our usage."
451,"so you voted for a big government authoritarian because you believe immigration to be the biggest threat.  sounds logical.   

we've been through this before.  irish, italians, poles, etc...  fear of immigrants is nothing new...and so long as they have something to contribute here, they have value.  

our biggest threat isn't immigration.  our biggest threat is the government itself.  so long as you vote for the 2-party system, liberty will always be in decline."
452,"> pretty easy to see how libertarianism leads to alt-right racism, especially when you paint everyone who thinks that welfare is beneficial for everyone, that open borders help the economy, and that abortion isn't murder as the enemy.

lol.  which libertarian ~~scholar~~ alt-right troll did you cherry-pick for that statement.  seriously, you think because someone claims to be a libertarian it makes them a libertarian?  no, their positions make them libertarian.

that statement is as far from libertarian as i can imagine.  while yes, we're against welfare of any type (corporate or individual), we're for more open immigration policies and believe abortion is up to the individual.

protip:  libertarians don't mention race when debating policy.  it's irrelevant.  we don't care what race, creed or religion someone is...their individual liberty is as precious and protected as our own."

454,"> seti@home was shut down a few weeks ago.

wow.  it had been probably 6 or 7 years since i've used it.  my pc is so badly out of date, i needed all the cycles i could get just to run my normal workloads."
455,"to me that means one of 2 things.

1. that they already had a predilection to such beliefs
2. that we have done a poor job explaining libertarianism.

personally, i think it's #1.  they're drawn to libertarianism for one reason.  they see libertarians standing up for freedom of speech and freedom of association so they think, ""hey, that's us!""  defending freedom of speech and defending the actual speech are two different things.  after some time they realize that libertarianism doesn't fit so they find a home in the alt-right.  there's no real pipeline.  one does not go from believing in individual liberty and the nap to becoming an alt-right racist that wishes to suppress the freedom of another group.

i don't think it's number 2...because most of the real libertarians here are more than capable of debating and expressing libertarian views...as well as weeding out the right-wing posers."
456,so what's the real backstory on this?  viral marketing?
457,"i'd like to see a game with this kind of gameplay...but every single one of these i've looked at does not have a single bit of that in the gameplay.

459,"there was one but i can't reca the name.

460,i like the game but i think it's way overrated. certainly worth playing.
461,"late to the party. 

i'd like to add in depraved awakening as probably the best of its class.  great art, interesting game play, excellent story and writing from phillygames. 

for html-based games redemption for jessika.  sadly, tlaero has retired so we won't see any more games from her(though her partner is still making art for games with a new writer) 

witch trainer still cracks me up.  i wish akabur would get his groove back.

i should also mention melody as one of the better games.   dating my daughter was on its way but the patreon crackdown really killed it. 

finally... and i'm surprised it hasn't gotten much attention, chloe18.  a game where the main character doesn't have huge breasts."

463,"he warned us about ""tyranny of the majority,"" but he didn't warn us that the majority would be the two-party system."
464,"it was scott glenn that changed his view after hearing that recording.

i'm still against the death penalty...for one very good reason.  there have been 166 death row exonerations in the us and we know that the justice system is horribly flawed.  too many innocent people are convicted on scant evidence (obviously not these two asshats).  consequently,  i'll tolerate scum like norris and bittaker living and dying in prison far better than an innocent person being put to death."
465,i never thought an audio recording could give someone ptsd...but after reading the transcript (only once) i'm certain i would have gotten ptsd from listening to that audio recording.  hearing the jurors cry from outside the courtroom and then watching people in attendance leave in tears...was horrible enough.

my biggest use case is virtual machines.  i don't have a ""homelab"" per se, my workstation acts as my homelab.  i do a lot of testing.  i need to be able to replicate some production infrastructure (domain controller, dns, etc.) in order to test other things i'm working on.  my current workstation is 9 years old and i can barely run 1 vm on it now (i have upgraded the video card twice).  i wanted 128gb of ram but i can't swing that cost right now...so i'm stuck with 64gb for now (probably for quite a while...i ordered the parts for before everything went to shit...not spending anymore disposable income).

514,businesses could remain open as long as they give their employees danger pay and proper protection and as long as customers are pre-warned that entering the establishment is life threatening.   the problem with the virus is that no one knows who is contagious until it's too late.    symptoms don't show for the first six days of infection or more.  the smoking analogy fails here because you can smell smoke and avoid it.

592,"papatine: ""i am every sith"" to  rey: ""i am every jedi""

""i'm downloading the knowledge of all my ancestors"" may be a bit of an overused trope.  from lady jessica's ""i am every bene gesserit reverend mother"" to lexa in the 100's ""i am every commander"" but it resonates within us and makes the battle more meaningful.  all the jedi vs all the sith. 

i enjoyed the movie.  i liked how rey got to choose who she wanted to be.   i don't mind how the 9 movies are tied up to be a saga about the struggle between the  palpatines and the skywalkers for control of the iron throne.  skywalkers for the win.  that's all that matters."

594,because you were there?  both meaty and veggie historical diet theories are just our best guesses. no one knows what triggered brain growth but i heard it was meat that made the brain and the brain was only then able to create agriculture.
595,"the problem with medical  science is that it can only make conclusions based on what it has observed within its strict conditions.   even if we know that many people have safely eaten the keto way for decades, science cannot state that it is safe long-term until it has been ""proven"" by studies by science.   if funding was provided for a three month study of keto, and keto was proven safe in that study, science would state that keto is safe for three months.  doctors giving advise would say that keto is safe for three months a time because they will only give advice that can be backed up by science to avoid lawsuits.  i believe the longest keto has been studied is two years, and doctors quoting that study are now saying keto is safe for two years at a time."

when the news is telling me that such and such number of people have died from covid-19, don't they really mean that they died from complications such as respiratory failure etc.?

if i died from a heart attack, would official cause of death be high cholesterol or heart failure?

hypothetically, if someone dies from something like respiratory failure caused by an underlying condition but just so happens to contract covid-19 without being infected long enough for covid-19 to aggravate the condition, if they test positive do they get added to the number of deaths?

i think dentists aren't very nice sometimes. it's the year 2020 and i think we need a better way to see the dentist. 

keeping good oral hygiene by brushing 2-3 times a day after meals and flossing will prevent visits to the dentist is what they say. although i agree with that, it won't prevent a checkup. 

my daughter doesn't like to brush her teeth and i don't like making her do it but i have to or else she will have to go more often. 

does it frustrate you when you go to the dentist? 

what do you do to prepare yourself for it?"

1204,"51/m. left chicago to be a temporary caregiver to both parents (fall; both w back injuries) before the region shutdown.  my industry was the first to go dark (live entertainment).  their necessary procedures have been delayed b/c of covid. 

they’re seeing an assisted care facility in their future; seeing their fear of losing their independence is heartbreaking. 

i’m wondering when they’re finally sorted if i’m going to have a job to return to.  still paying rent in chicago. 

b/c they’re vulnerable and impaired, i’m on their schedule, watching the collapse of the western world from my parents’ basement while they’re watching fox news and thinking this will all blow over soon, as if retirement homes aren’t vulnerable. 

been helping them throw away unnecessary things (like vhs tapes).  it occurred to me that we all imagined a future where things mattered, be they unsorted photos or sales award trophies or the high score in a video game, and how wrong we all are; there’s never enough time and the only thing that matters is easing each others’ way through."
1205,"as a chicagoan, there’s endless productions shooting here, but often presented as being somewhere else - mostly as gotham for the last 20y. 

batwoman is currently in production here (or was until the lead got injured).  all of the dark knight trilogy used the chicago river and the financial district (as well as other locations). the hospital the joker blew up was a decommissioned kraft factory on the west side. 

all the transformers movies were shot here. 

one of the reasons is that illinois (not chicago) doesn’t offer the tax incentives other places do to invite media production (see georgia as an example of contradiction). 

also, our weather has more dramatic shifts than the metropoli you mentioned; we can shift 100 degrees fahrenheit in less than a hundred days. it can be expensive to suspend shooting due to weather. 

sidenote: chicago used to be the capital of commercial film, until charlie chaplain moved his production facilities to la b/c real estate was pennies in comparison."

1209,"it’s my understanding that “a control standard” is not the same as rent control.  by a standard, it means things like jacking rent as a form of gentrification would be preventable, as would putting a lid on how much rent can be increased annually.  

in chicago, there’s a statute that establishes a maximum percentage of increase on a renewing lease and it’s tied to how much the landlord invests back into the property: the landlord can’t both neglect his property and escalate the rent. 

one of the upsides of that: renters with student children don’t get priced out of their school district every other semester. 

to that, not every city has rent control standards; the result is transient residents without building a community or economic base - so all the bothers of a transient population (crime, stalled economy) are institutionalized.

1221,"urban renter here.  initially fled the suburbs/rural area for an education, stayed for the culture and the mix of stability and flexibility: i’ve moved to different neighborhoods to broaden my life experiences and i’ve never been financially torpedoed by a broken water heater or brush fire/flood/tornado.  

but most importantly is the culture; even just the kinds and quality of foods available.  when i visit family in suburbs or rural areas i’m frequently disappointed in the quality and plurality of available food options.  and entertainment.  

i could do what i do for a living in an adjacent suburb, but my commute would eat all my clock and instead i can read on the train. finally, anonymity: i’m not competing with my neighbors’ lawn care regimen nor are we terribly interested in getting in each others’ business - we just live our lives and greet each other when we pass."

1229,"thank you. 

i can only imagine how awful it is for women where (conceivably) every man you pass is a potential threat. 

i try to do the courtesy of not engaging with them i don’t know so we can all just get on with doing our do. 

once i was lost in a village in england. i stopped a stranger (politely) approaching me on the sidewalk. his face went all “aw, bugger me, this!”  so i just said, “directions. lost.”  he warmed right up, even changed his route to walk me part of the way. i didn’t find his initial reaction rude; i do the same living my life in chicago.   as soon as i know you’re not asking me for something that isn’t yours, i’m happy to help, ya?

1232,"i’ve been drug tested when working on job sites - but not always by my employer; working as an outside contractor at a casino and on construction sites.  

my understanding is that it was for hard drugs (heroin/narcotics, meth); things that could alter cognitive abilities or motivate theft due to addiction - but that varied from site to site; sometimes pot was included, sometimes not (none of the states in concern here had legalized marijuana). 

on construction sites there was random drug testings performed by the contractor (the company that hired the union labor).  in a couple of cases, i had workers walk off the job to protect themselves when their number came up for a random drug test. the union, however, protected their job.

one case i had a worker escorted from the property for testing positive after presenting documentation (prior to taking his urine) from his union-assigned doctor for a prescription for a pain killer while recovering from a work-related injury (on different job site: fella was an iron worker that had a fall; he was assigned as a light-duty supervisor). 

i was taken to a hospital after being injured at work (threw my back out). i declined a prescription for pain killers (they make me depressed and effect my hypoglycemia).  i was screened at the time (policy: to see if the individual can be blamed for the incident) and “randomly” tested again 10d later.  when i was dismissed 3wks later, having had two drug screening tests performed within 30d made me eligible for mandatory dismissal.  

i came away with the impression that the drug tests were both a tool to protect against litigation and to handle personnel.

i’ve never heard of someone in a suit getting tested/dismissed."
1234,"thank you for your response. 

admittedly, you’ve done more due diligence than i have.  greatly respect you’ve linked support to your argument.  

haven’t read it all as i write just now; wanted to respond before the day takes me. 

given the clarity of your response, i’mma take the time to reconsider my impressions. 

all said, is there candidate you’re supporting?"
1235,"valid points. 

re: bernie and warren.  ya, totally; they’ve done a right awful job presenting their plans.  and i doubt i can do any better.  that said, as i understand it, the money you pay out-of-pocket for insurance (be it in payroll deductions, deductibles, over-priced medications, etc) is transformed into taxes - but at an overall lesser amount than the total of your out-of-pocket-and-payroll expenses, income lost due to illness, financial ruin due to bankruptcy, etc. for those willing and able, additional coverage will still be available for private purchase. 

to me, the easiest equivalence is like a costco membership: i have to pay to be a member to be able to buy the goods that are sold at less than comparable retail prices; i’m spending money but i’m spending less and getting more. and i can still buy an extended warranty if i want. 

again, that’s how i understand it. and i’m no authority on the subject. 

re: even-metered. these debates are such an awful format - no one looks good. when i’ve seen her even- metered is in interviews (talk shows, sunday morning panel discussions) and the occasional cspan footage.  

it’s so saddening that any candidate that can complete a sentence presents as a one-eyed-man, but such are the times. 

re: a candidate promising to end insurance. i agree that no one is selling the idea well. which is a shame; here’s my personal insight: 

my significant other works for one of the largest medical insurance companies. her opinions influence mine as that’s how she spends 50hr/wk - she knows from the blood on her hands how broken and corrupted the insurance system is and knows reformation could eliminate her +12y career. she’s still in favor of a medicare for all with add’l coverage option program.  

my oldest friend has juvenile-onset diabetes (type 1). he’s been insulin dependent for ~35y.  until obamacare, he was either unable to get insurance or it was cost-prohibitive and/or it was entirely not insurance b/c the deductible was so high.  as it is, he’s in a dead end gig b/c it’s the best job in his field with quasi-competent coverage.  he recently had to sue to get the glucose meter his endocrinologist had been recommending for +/-3y. 

my best friend suffered with a medical condition for years without proper diagnosis b/c her coverage denied testing - for what turned out to be a treatable brain tumor, the same type and location that took her mother at the same age.   after 2y of applying for state assistance, she had surgery,.  she had to leave the workforce to be eligible. without assistance, she would have likely orphaned her minor daughter.  now she’s able to provide for her family and her daughter’s college. 

one of my dearests is german. she presented behavior-altering symptoms and was diagnosed with glioblastoma (brain cancer).   her job was held for her pre- and post-surgery, her chemo and radiation treatments and even her cab fare to/from was covered by the state.  her life expectancy is +/- 50% longer b/c of her coverage and treatment.  my uncle passed away from the same diagnosis in 3mos b/c his insurance wouldn’t cover treatments to the extent his neurologist recommended (his was a few years ago, hers was 18mos ago).

20y ago i opened up two fingers with a knife at home.  it cost me $1500 to see a doctor and get five stitches (my then job didn’t have benefits). two months ago i suffered a similar injury.  i spent ~$40 on superglue, antibiotic ointment and bandages and diy’d it myself. 

yes, my taxes will change. i’m not fully financially stable but i’m willing to pony up for some security that i won’t end up homeless if i catch something beyond my control. my so and i are childless, but i recognize the value of paying taxes to fund schools. 

(before it comes up: my so and i haven’t been dating long enough to consider marriage just yet - and i violently hate that medical insurance should be considered as part of deciding whether or not to make such a personal commitment. that’s some disingenuous dowry bullshit.)

these stories can’t be mine alone.  no one is content with the system as it is. there are successful models in other developed nations. of note, japan has the longest life expectancy, one of the strongest economies, and one of the highest standards of living. they’ve had a nationalized health care system since 1935.   not to say they’re perfect, but that little snatch of islands are doing it better than we are. 

i refuse to believe america can’t do it and do it better. 

so, ya, i do believe that americans can be coerced.  history has shown americans can be sold anything if the message is loud enough. 

and this i believe: any government that doesn’t invest in its people is tyrannical.  

sorry to have written so much. thanks for engaging."
1236,"disagree: while things are so far to the right, everything looks left. 

warren is wickedly attractive as a candidate: i want a president that has done their homework and studied for the test and can deliver an even-metered argument. 

i don’t disagree with anything necessarily bernie except i think he fails in delivering his message. 

certainly hope biden does not get the candidacy; there’s just too much good-ole-boy grandad about him anymore. i respect him. but i also respect my father enough to take the car keys from him because he’s just not as focused and energetic as he once was.

1280,"stumbled across an article explaining how the east coast hardcore scene succeeded b/c of bernie - but i’ve lost track of it. 

the gist: bernie allowed a youth-run center to operate out of the mayoral offices focused primarily on music. 

it evolved into its own thing after becoming a go-to stop on the punk rock circuit. 

bernie: why are you kids in trouble?
kids: this town sucks! there’s fkall to do!
bernie: what is it you want to do?
kids: we wanna rock!
bernie: ok. i like music. come to my office; we’ll set you up in the basement. 
kids:  can we bring our friends?
bernie: please do! bring everyone. just quit fking up out here and bothering the cops.

1281,"the premise, as explained to me in chicago 30y ago is this: if you’re too bright, you’re likely to get bored and start to learn how to trick/work the system. there is an iq ceiling to accepted applications. different departments and branches have different standards (municipal cops compared to staties). 

being a cop means spending your life only seeing people at their worst and having to expect danger. always. 

i don’t fault cops for becoming cynical. what i do have a problem with is that there’s no process to curb their cynicism before it becomes self-righteousness, like what we saw here.  

add the paramilitary training they receive now to the cynicism and decidedly unintelligent (not meaning stupid - meaning not intelligent, as in not in the thin part on the right of the bell curve) and what we have are what we got; pawns who think they’re knights. 

so if you’re of reasonable intelligence and you think the cat with badge ain’t, you’re prolly right.  don’t get agitated- use as few words as you’re able and be polite. 

don’t forget they’re doing a job you don’t want to do.

made a conscious choice to not have kids unless i could meet the following criteria:
1) be able to provide for them at least as well as my parents did for me. which wasn’t posh, mind you. my folks were born pre-war and did okay for themselves despite formal education. 
2) met someone i thought would be a great partner and a good parent.  that said, being coupled was never a prime priority, so i didn’t invest a lot in hunting; more hoped it would happen organically.  came close once, but tragedy happens... 
3) i felt confident i was bringing life to a hospitable planet. 

at times i toss between feeling like i missed the boat and feeling like i dodged a bullet, but i don’t regret making that initial commitment to myself.  my goddaughter is amazing and my nieces and nephews are great in their own way. i get to spoil tf out of them and not have the trappings of a sour marriage or excessive debt.  and i get to travel and have fantastic, rich friendships."

1305,i'm thinking at this point in their life they probably put more effort into their show and don't cut it short or anything like they did when they were young. probably the best time to see them. they will be back.

i think motley crue, poison, def leppard and joan jett (did i get the bands right?) were supposed to tour together this year but i'm sure thats done.

of all the hair bands motley crue and def leppard are among those that i'm ok with. suprised no one put ""looks that kill"" or something like ""red hot"" by the crue up yet.

theres a wicked live version of ""red hot"" that i might put up soon to give hair band guys some love. motley crue can bring it live."
1315,"i put a lush song from 1990 (sweetness and light) on the gen x subreddit yesterday, and due to its popularity i decided to put a later one on here for xennials, though i realize you guys might be a tad young to remember. this is another of my favorites by them behind sweetness and light. 

i think angela chase would approve ;). enjoy!"
1317,"very popular in the genx subreddit, so i figured xennials may appreciate it as well."

1320,"you bet, i think i will give it a couple days but jesus and mary chain is on deck.

mbv, husker du, the replacements, and wire are my favorite bands of all time. echo and the bunnymen is also among my favorites, if you have a chance to see them live, take advantage. i really like lush as well, though their style did change.

whats cool is that lush covered several wire songs (and wire themselves loved their versions) and mbv covered wire with the magnificent ""map ref 41"", a case where one of my fav bands covered one of my fav bands and did it right."
1321,agreed
1322,i still like all those bands in that grouping.
1323,"out of any boundaries i've done for any generations this one has been the toughest to work out....millenials have a fit when any bit of 1995 gets taken from them, and i originally had all of 1995 for gen k but millenials convinced me that class of 2013 was theirs. this is a case where i almost say, if you think you are zillenial you are. especially since you are less than 3 months away. perhaps 3 months away and adamant about being a zillenial puts you there."
1324,"one of my favorite songs of all time (its from 1990), just feels right to me. they do an outstanding version of wire's great ""outdoor miner"" as well.  i may talk about gen jones alot, but i have a lot of appreciation for genx and the way they carried the music onward."
1325,"great song, i was right there with them when this came out. this band was greatly influenced by wire's magnificent 3rd album ""154"" (1979), which laid the groundwork for the lions share of 1980's post-punk.

but honestly when you said early depeche mode i was expecting one of their early singles like ""just can't get enough"" or ""new life"". come to think of it though 1983 was early for this long-lived band.

great call any way you look at it."
1326,"i still use cds in my 2007 car. 6 cd changer, love it."

1328,"as much as the 1958-1964 group are separate from boomers in reality, i did grow up into my teens in the mid-70's wishing i had grown up as a hippie boomer in the middle 60's with that culture and that rich inspired late 60's music, we remember the 60's as kids and there is indeed a longing or jonesing among us that gave us that generation jones name. but alas we grew up in different circumstances as reality set in. but, that being said, loved the 1980's, that was our time to shine!

i like that you are partially standing up for gen jones also, even if its in the guise of boomers. rap and punk to jones, metal largely to boomers. as much as i rail against our older brothers the boomers they did their share of good also which is often taken for granted, and people forget the male population had the prospect of being drafted to vietnam, and not all boomers were rich enough or connected to avoid that. none of us have been faced with that.

we were the first group to come up after the boomers did the heavy lifting to combat social injustices, so our generation was the first to have women in the workforce (other than maybe ww2?) in large numbers, and we were much more racially integrated than previous generations."
1329,its his birthday today i believe....or would have been
1330,millenials are like 24-37 years old right now if i did my math right
1332,"let's not go there, early 60's born were not part of the boomer generation no matter how much they tried to convince us we were. we know better. we had nothing to do with the problems caused today either, other than sit idly by like our neighbors in gen x did. our footprint in politics is small (like gen x) unless you want to blame obama for everything wrong with the world. might have a gen jones vp if amy klobuchar or kamala harris gets there though.

and when you think about it, the first genxers are only 3 1/2 years younger than me (i was born in august), which we all know by now.....is nothing as far as time."
1333,"yes, you are right, i should have known better, i bought the album first week it was released. good call. i guess it was only a couple years between first 2 albums, seemed longer."
1334,"haha i remember belonging to that, i had to get iron butterfly's ""in  gadda da vida"" because i ran out of albums i needed that they had. what a trip. around 1977 or so i joined, about 16 years old.

a few good albums there, aerosmith - rocks and journey - infinity are probable the best albums you can get from those 2 bands if you can stomach journey. toys in the attic a close 2nd for aerosmith.

but my god a lot of awful crap in there.

looks like advert is from the early 80's since boston's ""don't look back"" is there."
1335,"great analysis and not surprising, they were often considered part of the paisley underground movement when they started in the early to mid 80's."
1336,"haha, yeah the beat goes on, we had the older people get ours too. i guess that's always been the way."
1337,"i could see that, probably hero takes a fall also on college radio."
1338,"i guess my logic was sound then by picking them over katrina here! haha, fascinating!"
1339,"i think we always got along well with gen x, certainly in music there are plenty mixed bands of both and mucho respect. michael stipe and kurt cobain for instance were good friends, i think thurston moore (sonic youth) and cobain also. bob mould seemed to get along with everyone in gen x. the surviving members of nirvana and joan jett seemed to have a bond. eddie vedder introduced rem into rock and roll hall of fame. on and on. basically, we partied together."
1340,"well, metallica is a gen jones band unless you go with the 1961-1981 definition of gen x, same with megadeth and slayer, but even then they might be jones. i'd have to check.

we weren't the group specifically called baby boomers but we were part of the baby boom, strange as it sounds. we were the 2nd big birth rate group after ww2. we were so big and varied that we were responsible for creating both sides of the coin...  many (but not all!) of the 80's hair band music (motley crue, def leppard, and uggh poison and bon jovi) and most of the ""antithesis"" bands (metallica, megadeth, slayer, and the lions share of post-punk and 80's alternative) were gen jones bands also. i have a theory about this but i don't want to get into it now.

while genx bands were highly influenced by many gen jones bands, the one area they killed in the early 90's were the hair bands with the arrival of nirvana and pearl jam. even a gen jones band like soundgarden helped put the nail in the coffin and became a major iconic band for gen x."
1342,"i like your posts but nearly all the great bands and artists of the 60's were born in what i call the rock and roll generation (1940-1945), a war babies cusper generation between silent and boomers that came of age with first generation rock and roll like elvis presley, buddy holly, chuck berry, and little richard.....the ""american graffitti"" generation. this group was the creators of all that great music , not the boomers. boomers were the consumers. the beatles, stones, the who, doors, brian wilson, hendrix, dylan, kinks et all were from this generation. they had grown up loving that first-generation rock and roll and built on it.

boomers were those that created disco (thankfully we in gen jones cut disco off right away, we hated it, and it quickly died near the beginning of the 80's), the mellow singer/songwriter early 70's music like james taylor and carly simon, glam rock like slade, sweet, queen, kiss, also fleetwood mac and the eagles stuff, arena rock like styx and journey, and the harder edged rock that american gen jones picked up on before punk....bands like aerosmith, van halen, rush, ac/dc, and boston. van halen was after punk but so mind-blowingly refreshing at the time they could not be ignored. those were created by boomers.

you are right about stevie nicks, debbie harry, and dolly parton, but don't forget the wilson sisters in heart and pat benatar. but it wasn't until gen jones stepped in that we finally got all female rock bands, i'm sure the runaways (joan jett, lita ford, cherie currie, sandy west) were probably first since they were doing it at 15 or 16."
1343,"thanks for your input, let me mull it over."
1344,i like your taste already.
1345,"when i originally had done this i had millenials ending in 1994, but millenials convinced me to move it up to at least part of 1995....it's a difficult break point.

were you born within about 2 months of the break point? remember i have sept - dec as gen k."
1346,"generation jones (1958-1964 in u.s., 1954-1964 in u.k.)

brought the founders of both amazon and netflix and the first black u.s  president (ok technically half black).

and for music

first all-girl rock bands (the runaways, the bangles, the go-gos) i believe, but i could be wrong here, there may have been others.

punk (including hardcore, boomers brought proto-punk though)

new wave (joint with boomers, talking heads and the police are  boomers, elvis costello and gary numan are jones for instance)

post-punk (most all varieties, the cure, wire, joy division/new order, the smiths, echo and the bunnymen, the rain parade, technopop like duran duran and simple minds)

alternative and college radio (rem, replacements, husker du, cocteau twins, jesus and mary chain and my bloody valentine for example)

thrash (metallica, megadeth, slayer)

rap (original old-school like grandmaster flash, ice-t, run dmc, and public enemy though gen x modernized it and brought in some of the best hip-hop artists like tupac)

i just wanted to make this clear, although gen x brought their share to the table no doubt. this might not be a popular post to make here but in defense of gen x much of the music i mentioned has gen x as the intended audience, so they are often the consumers and play a large part. basically gen jones made music for genx to consume mostly in the 1980's.

most of the bands of the latest 80's and the early to mid-90's are gen x with one important exception: soundgarden is a gen jones band, i think all or most all members were born early 60's. jeff ament, great bassist of mother love bone/pearl jam is also gen jones, but both nirvana and pearl jam are obviously x bands (so what if vedder was born a week early, he is x) in totality as are the scores of bands and artists that came out early to middle 1990's.

just the music perspective..."
1347,"yes, i tend to like their 80's work over their 90's work."
1348,"yep, for sure."

1351,"i had to look up this ""adulting"" thing, i mean seriously? this is a thing? millenials speak a different language to me, they really do, the internet went to their heads. they needed grounding in the real world. generation x and xennials i can relate to very well, but millenials? what the...."
1352,"thank you, this was well received in the zillenial subreddit a couple months ago, and they had a big hand with feedback for putting the finishing touches on it. kudos to those zillenials.

haha it also helped that my nephew was an earliest zillenial (born sept. '95) and i didn't forget sitting up with him and watching all those shows on cartoon network! dare i say it? i enjoyed some of them also!"
1353,"haha got a laugh at that one....but i'd stick with gen jones since it was made a name in 1999, finally! goomers is too close to gomers which is too close to homers!"
1354,"i would have millenials as september 1983- august 1995....they are the first generation to graduate high school in a post-9/11 world.

**1983 (9/1/83) -1995 (8/31/95) = generation y or millenials** ( *class of 2002 - class of 2013*, major generation, **12 years**), millenials are the first major generation to come of age with the pc sales boom and the wild west of the internet in the late 90's. as a result they are the first generation that could realistically use the internet as a medium for mass communication before high school. millenials are also the first generation to graduate high school *after* the tragic events of 9/11. they grew up or came of age with star wars prequels, *buffy the vampire slayer*, *dawsons creek*, *friends*, *futurama*, *daria*, netflix, steam, flip-top phones, windows 98/2000/xp, cd then dvd players, aol chatrooms and my space, pokemon, n64, dreamcast, and the 6th generation consoles (ps2, gamecube, original xbox). they remember 9/11 clearly.

with internet gaming coming to fruition and with these guys often being hardcore gamers, games as diverse as diablo 2, half-life/half-life 2, counter-strike, starcraft/brood war, world of warcraft, guild wars, unreal tournament 2004, battlefield 2, as well as console games like original halo, metroid prime, ocarina of time, soul calibur (1 and 2), wind waker, resident evil 4, super smash brothers melee, and gta: vice city and/or san andreas were often on their playlist.

***fun fact: with this model all (or nearly all, some may have dropped out) millenials in the u.s. were in 1st-12th grade during the 2001-2002 school year. so basically nearly all millenials in the u.s. were in school when 9/11 happened! it just worked out that way.***"
1355,"thanks for your feedback, zillenials gave me lot of feedback to work with, they deserve a lot of credit."
1356,"then just ignore it. i post plenty of stuff that has nothing to do with that either. but i admit i get annoyed when people lump us in with that selfish group that screwed us first and continued down the line. no way we are part of that group, all we contributed was obama, nothing to do with those born in the late 1940's. i'm standing up for our group that gets completely ignored even more than gen x, so just ignore my ramblings if they bother you. thats all you have to do. if people start to recognize us as a separate generation in earnest i will do you a favor and create a separate gen jones subreddit and not mention it here anymore. genxers would always be welcome of course, it would be heavy on mid to late 70's thru early to mid 80's."
1357,on a side note i thought that was one of the most twisted episodes of walking dead. it starts out with lizzie playing with zombies as she can't seem to register the difference between living and undead.
1358,definitely agree with you there.
1359,"i personally don't consider myself a baby boomer in any event anyways if i am honest with myself, we were always told we were but we don't fit there, we all know that, 1960-1964 really isn't part of any group (we used to be called tweeners uggh) and i don't think 1958 and 1959 are either, though '58 and '59 are more boomer-like than those born in the early 60's, but they had some future game-changers in that group that tied with the 1980's and gen x also. we are on the cusp between.

we are either a separate gen jones (1958-1964) or truly part of gen x (1961-1981 but i think 1960 belongs here also at least if that's the case).

in any event we are with you gen x, we aren't going to be wiped out either and our millions in the '60-'64 group got your back, and those millenials are getting cocky!"
1360,"yep, zillenial for sure, here's my take:

**1995 (9/1/95 on) -1999 (8/31/99)** **= generation k (katniss) or zillenials** ( *class of 2014 - class* *of 2017*, cusper generation, **4 years**) the generation born around the release of the revolutionary windows '95 operating system (and the evolutionary windows '98), these guys spent their childhood glued to the tv set for the latest episode of *powerpuff girls, dexters laboratory,* or *johnny bravo* on cartoon network but came of age in late elementary, middle and early highschool with sweeping social and technological changes as a result of smart phones, social media, and sites like youtube. their first phones were often feature (dumb) phones like the motorola razr but some in this generation got upgrades to a smart phone by high school. lcd wide-screen hdtv's, blu-ray, the nintendo wii (with its wii remote) and windows 7 were now becoming more commonplace by middle school and this generation was often impacted by tv shows like lizzie mcguire, american idol, and american horror story (later on) as well as movies like avatar and of course the hunger games. they share a love of harry potter books/movies with late 80's/90's millenials and a love for hannah montana (tend toward female) and spongebob squarepants (as kids and teens) with early to middle gen z. most zillenials were able to vote in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, and they constituted the youngest voting block. like any cusper generation they have an understanding of their border generations to a differing degree and can feel more at home with either one or the other, or just as themselves. they may or may not have memories of 9/11 but not much emotional impact at this age unless the family was directly affected. best friends sophie turner and maisie williams (sansa and arya stark from game of thrones) are from generation k, they might make good icons for this generation.

like the millenials, members of gen k were also enjoying games on the 6th generation consoles and eventually the 7th generation consoles (xbox 360, playstation 3, nintendo wii) once they reached middle or high school. in addition to games on the 6th generation consoles (listed in the millenials description) zillenials often played 7th generation games like the mass effect series (1-3), the elder scrolls series (particularly skyrim), portal (1 and 2), grand theft auto v, bioshock, call of duty 4: modern warfare and the super mario galaxy games.

***fun fact: nearly 100% of all members of generation k were in high school (u.s., 9th - 12th grade) during the 2013/2014 school year. and nearly 100% of students in high school at that time were part of generation k according to this model.***"
1361,"haha, i've been on the millenial subreddit and many of them really do think that way."
1362,yes they were! i was lucky to be at a good age thru that decade.
1363,"i completely agree, i was at an age and an area where i could soak in that early 80's goodness. most of their best work was before ""don't you"" and often times they like to distance themselves from that song anyways. i had both new gold dream and sparkle in the rain so i feel you brother.

i never considered ""don't you"" a gen x anthem.....however i would consider it and ""hungry like the wolf"" as 2 of the most iconic songs of the decade.

when i think of gen x anthem i think of sonic youths ""teenage riot"". at least on the american side."
1364,"this one takes me back, i was stationed in england in the u.s. air force in 1981-1984,  takes me back to my favorite british girlfriend.......the one that got away. great memories of england, it was a good time to be there. i will never forget.

young jim kerr here, i'm certain this concert takes place in their native scotland, images from glasgow maybe? to think everyone in that crowd is in their 50's and 60's now. but it looks like this was a fun memory for them. i was over there at that time, wish i had been there at the concert.

thought i'd bring this up to show my fellow americans that simple minds had plenty of music  before (don't you) forget about me and alive and kicking in case some genxers were too young to remember that.

this and 1982's new gold dream 81 82 83 84 are my favorite songs by simple minds. how about you guys?

molly ringwald would have stamped her seal of approval on this song."
1365,"we had the threat of nuclear war in most of the 1980's but man i loved that decade. no internet at all, but i loved it.

the mtv 80's, where they actually played music videos. and man did i have it for martha quinn!"
1366,yeah no doubt a younger girl had a crush on him as the older high school boy. that's what we'd like to believe.
1367,haha sounds about right
1368,of the 5 he was the odd person out. someone had to be and he was the youngest and male. girls usually get with older guys at that age and time. don't know about these days.
1369,one of the best movies of the 1980's........and also i'm sure one of the cheapest to make.
1370,"thanks, that makes more sense, both x and doors were la bands, and i'm sure ray stayed connected or even lived there early 80's."
1371,agreed
1372,"i can understand all of that, thanks for setting me straight and giving your perspective.i probably see the big chill as you see st. elmo's fire! cannot relate."
1373,"they were the best band of the 1960's thanks to a string of great albums beginning with face to face that still sound great today. shangri - la probably my fav. song, with waterloo sunset, days, village green preservation society, and animal farm up there.

and i am american."
1374,"always, though it was never one of my fav doors songs. it was decent, though i liked quite a few other songs off of strange days a bit better.

echo had some influence from the doors anyways and i think ray manzarek had a hand on their first album if i remember correctly. or was that x?"
1375,thats for damn sure. i'd still like to believe but its tough sometimes.
1376,thanks brother you too.
1377,"you guys are pulling out all the stops tonight, echo and the bunnymen and xtc?

xtc is an acquired taste for many, but to me skylarking is one of the 2 or 3 best albums ever made, love it, i don't know if its todd rundgrens input or andy and colins songs hitting their stride but the album is pretty much perfect, especially if you were lucky to have dear god included on it. its an album that gets better and better with repeated listenings and you never get tired of it.

ah, i see its the same person. seems our tastes match up well!"
1378,"one of the best bands of the 1980's......period. will sergeants guitar playing could be amazing.

i've seen probably at least a hundred concerts in the 1980's.

the 2nd time i saw them in philly was the best concert i have ever seen by anyone. they pulled out all the stops and played probably at least 25 of their songs, everything from rescue to the killing moon and silver. during their encore, they said the next song was coming up on their next album....that song was lips like sugar, and it was magnificent live. they were a band crying to be heard by a national audience. i swear every song i requested via shout they played, and often from their great first album crocodiles. i mean i shouted out ""all that jazz"" from crocodiles thinking no way they would play that. and whamo they got right into it, one of my favorite songs by them.

again, one of the best bands of the 1980's. girls jumped the stage for mcculluch several times but they played without a hitch.

first time i saw them was great also, they were playing with new order which is not too shabby especially since no decided to explore a little of their joy division catalogue.

oh and this song and movie are good also ;). i especially like the editing of the video.

another good candidate for this subreddit would be bring on the dancing horses with perhaps snippets from 16 candles in the video. or was it pretty in pink? one of them. i just know it was one with genxer molly."
1379,"it doesn't represent boomers at all, but gen jones definitely! we will take it off your hands happily. to be honest the more i think about it the movie has a 1980/1981 school year feel like freaks and geeks, where the oldest are gen jones and the youngest are gen x. that feels about right. 

high school in the late 1960's is different than high school early 1980's. we were not boomers, we did not have vietnam and woodstock on our minds, but we did actually have finding a job on our mind after the boomers took the jobs and we were competing with them and the millions of our own group for jobs in a saturated market! no wonder we partied so hard in high school. like the red-head in dazed and confused said, the 70's sucked, but we would be in our 20's in the 80's and it might turn out to be good ....and indeed most of us ended up doing well despite the 80's  recessions in our path."
1380,looks like the boomers are the cool ones in that pic haha....jeff bridges is the dude.
1381,"st. elmos fire and 3/5ths of breakfast club were gen jones, not boomers.

boomers were the big chill, and i couldn't get into that one either. if i were a boomer i suppose that should have been an easy one to get into, but it didn't speak to me. only interesting thing to me in that movie was meg tilly......ooooh da sexy! in fact meg tilly was the only gen jonser in that movie, the others were all boomers. she was just the young fling of the guy that died. meg was still in college when she got the part. phoebe cates, another lovely gen joneser had applied for that part, and though she didn't get it, she met future husband kevin kline on the set.

i don't understand the hate for gen jones,  we were integral to gen x pop culture growing up and we had a major hand in the grunge movement. we are closely tied together.

....and we were nothing like the boomers of the 60's (especially those of us born in the 1960's) other than the hair and some love for the late 60's music we remembered as wide-eyed kids, we took the high volume classic rock  and punk of the late 1970's and created alot of new and interesting music in the 1980's (for instance thrash bands like metallica, megadeth, and slayer) that was picked up and influential to gen x bands, not to mention post-punk and alternative. and you guys grew up with our guys as your icons, usually one generation influences the next.

but oh well. or as you guys say, whatever."
1382,"sean penn as spiccoli could represent gen jones in these pics,  thought about keanu reeves for gen jones, but nothing beats bob odenkirk as saul goodman. i've always felt gen jones was like bob odenkirks jimmie (saul) to boomers michael mckeans chuck, overshadowed and less pompous but perhaps sharper. so bob odenkirk for jones it is.

neither penn or reeves are members of gen x anyway.

how about the dude who starred with reeves in bill and teds, i think he's gen x.

haha don't use carrot top though.

or charlie sheen in one of his movies or when he was with those 2 porn girls or something from 2.5 men? has to be something there.

or even mathew mcconaghey?"
1384,"ah ok fair enough then. i don't agree with it, but so be  it."
1385,"you should, it's a very good show."
1386,"boomer generation is 12 years, same as silent, gen x, and millenial

boomers = 1946-1957 (major)

generation jones = 1958-1964 (cusper)

generation x = 1965-1976 (major)

oregon trail generation = 1977- august 1983 (cusper)

millenials = september 1983 - august 1995 (major)

no generation can last 20 years and have kids of the same generation. they have nothing in common if they are 20 years apart either. 12 is appropriate."
1387,"oh wow, you completely removed xennials, unless of course you don't believe in cuspers.

i'm sticking with september 1983 - august 1995 for millenials, a cool 12 years and not too long for the beginning of the generation to have nothing in common with the end.

this places millenials as the first generation to graduate high school post 9/11 and the last millenials born around the time of windows '95.

by coincidence there's nothing better than the number 12 anyways, you can divide the generation nicely still further in 3 or 4 for those so inclined.

also, with this model pretty much every american millenial was in school grades 1-12th in the 2001/2002 school year all bearing witness to the 9/11 attack....feels poetic."
1388,"i did a detailed analysis of each generation and came up with these dates concerning millenials:

oregon trail generation (ot generation or xennials) = 1977- august 1983, cusper generation, 6.5 + years, the last generation to graduate high school prior to 9/11

millenials (generation y) = september 1983 - august 1995, major generation, 12 years, the first generation to graduate high school post 9/11

zillenials (generation k [katniss]) = september 1995 - august 1999, cusper generation, 4 years"
1389,"i'd say xennials are 36-43 right now

millenials are 24-36 

zillenials are 20-24

gen zers are 9-20"
1390,"great show and iconic for xennials especially. it came out the year before windows '95 if i remember correctly.

they made the mistake of putting it up against friends, and claire wanted to do movies after anyways. she was pretty irreplaceable in the role."
1391,"thats a pretty poor analysis, you do realize that all of soundgarden, 2 key members of pearl jam, 3 of the 4 members of rem, all of husker du, the replacements, the runaways, thurston moore, and courtney love are members of generation jones right? you don't think any of them had a d.i.y. attitude? they are all boomers? what about grandmaster flash, ice-t and public enemy, were some of the most important early rappers boomers also? jello biafra and henry rollins? 90% of the iconic core brat pack? and thats just the american side and the tip of the iceberg. we were into the punk movement (which led to grunge) before gen x reached middle school. many of us were doing the things gen x takes credit for before they were. mtv etc. was right in our wheelhouse just like gen x. that is a shared experience as is the early part of the golden age of arcade gaming. this isn't a slight on gen x, i generally like genxers, i count many as friends.....it just would be nice to get the recognition we deserve. we are a generation between, neither boomer nor x (especially the 1960-1964 group). you can think those born in the latest 50's are more boomer-like, but other than the birth-rate numbers we in the early 60's were not. its mostly individual when it comes to 1958-1964, and especially 1960-1964 because gen jones is a cusper transitional generation. but just like the oregon trail generation on the other side it is real.

your 2nd paragraph makes no sense, while i personally would like to see many of the ideas sanders talks about come to fruition, we know realistically it isn't going to happen at this time. how are those ideas going to pass through congress at this time? and sanders people can't even be bothered to vote for him against biden, so how is he going to beat the ""orange overlord""? it doesn't look like trump supporters are going to budge at all. be open-minded about things. but alas i don't want to stain this subreddit with politics.

i have never been a boomer and neither have my friends in the '60-'64 born range. that '46-'64 range is held by birth rate only and not by how we are. we aren't x either as i have said over and over, but we are somewhere in between.....which side depends on the individual, not anyones desire to push everyone in there as boomers because their siblings lean one way or another. cusper generations can lean either way or be comfortable as their own."
1393,"i still say the most forgotten group is the 1958-1964 group, we were casually lumped in with boomers though we have none of the life experiences and markers they had. ours was different we don't even have the same generation of parents most of the time, boomers had ""greatest"", we had silent.

imagine being lumped in with this bunch of self-serving group when the only major politician we contributed was president obama. i like to think we are generally more open-minded than the boomers partially because we were the first generation to grow up in a decidedly more integrated society. i want to see biden pick amy klobuchar as his running mate. i think she would do well as president if something happens to biden (assuming he beats trump).

we were overlooked so far as well as gen x."
1394,absolutely! brilliant dude...and as usual brilliant skit.
1395,thanks and you too.
1396,"yes, i apologize about that, sounds like you are doing the right things. your statements are sound and sensible, and my reply was probably more directed at the person who wishes the virus to wipe out an entire generation."
1397,they do end in august 1995
1398,"no no no

boomers = 1946-1957 (u.s., 12 years)

generation jones = 1958-1964 (u.s., 7 years)

generation x = 1965-1976 (12 years)

oregon trail generation = 1977- august, 1983 (last generation to grad h.s. before 9/11, 6.5 + years)

millenials = sept 1983 - august 1995 (12 years)

zillenials = sept 1995 - august 1999 (4 years)

gen z = sept 1999 - ? (probably about 12 years)"

1482,"yes, very much"
1483,"what about his pention, though?"
1484,you got your ass pounded and can’t admit it  lol
1485,by what metric? (serious question)
1486,that last paragraph is funny because it sure seems like the youth don’t mobilize when it comes to voting based on the past couple days. maybe we should nationalize instagram and make it the worlds biggest polling place. or maybe even reddit so the revolutionary youth won’t be inconvenienced! upvote for the presidency!    lmaooooooo
1487,"that’s like calling will & grace the edgiest thing on network tv in the 90s. you might be right, but it’s still will & fucking grace.

1489,what is falation
1490,i liked the blue eyes smoldering part
1491,"parentheses, huh?

it might be a funny schtick if you weren’t actually a baloney-licking retard."

1497,little chance of his being released before he dies but i am pretty sure this case is going to be a clusterfuck slog based on the multiple jurisdictions involved and the fact the case is being tried in sac even though they do not realistically have a prosecutable murder there. i guarantee the prosecution is going to try really hard to fuck this up despite all the dna
1498,"dan patrick? 

good god."
1499,lol nice troll shitbreath. i chuckled
1500,"ah, old-school punk....i always said i wanted to see the ramones before i died, and i did with one of the classic lineups in the middle 80's, most fun concert i have ever been to, every song was 1, 2, 3 go!, must have lost at least 10 lbs in the first 20 minutes, great stuff."
1501,"wow, that's a lineup! did you see my lush video i put up 2 days ago?"
1502,the ending was story-book perfect
1503,"awww no apology needed, 1990 feels like yesterday."
1505,"great that you caught them at a good time but i'm curious, did you see them 30 years ago in 1990 or is it 10 years ago in 2010. your statement confused me (not hard to do)."
1506,i'm thinking at this point in their life they probably put more effort into their show and don't cut it short or anything like they did when they were young. probably the best time to see them. they will be back.
1507,i wish i could give you more upvotes! awesome final touch of a great song.
1508,"hmmmm....does not come to mind, if i figure that out i will let you know."
1509,"yeah this song strikes me just right, i hear some beach boys influence in there even."
1510,"they have a reputation for being very moody with their performances, either they are into it or they aren't. least thats what i've heard. but man they made some good music on vinyl at the least and probably live when they are feeling it. but yeah, the paying customer should get their moneys worth not 3 songs or 20 minutes of play time as they sometimes did. the replacements were somewhat similar in that way as far as performing, you didn't know what to expect because of their excessive drinking, wouldn't surprise me if it was other drugs for j/m chain."
1511,"i promise no more videos for a few days........my favorite jesus and mary chain song. on psychocandy it edges out ""the hardest walk"" and ""taste of cindy"" for me....but barely."
1512,"this is actually the 1986 2nd version, it was used in ""some kind of wonderful""."
1515,"i saw these guys in concert last year with journey, hair bands are not usually my cup of tea (if you've seen my alternative and post-punk videos on here you would know that) but my 1969 born genxer buddy got tickets for us as he absolutely loves the 1980's (as do i for different reasons) and he loves hair bands and truth be told we had a great time! i knew most of the lyrics to the songs they played for both bands somehow, it was right in my late teens early 20's wheelhouse. great fun, most everyone was in their 40's-60's there haha.

i think motley crue, poison, def leppard and joan jett (did i get the bands right?) were supposed to tour together this year but i'm sure thats done.

of all the hair bands motley crue and def leppard are among those that i'm ok with. suprised no one put ""looks that kill"" or something like ""red hot"" by the crue up yet.

theres a wicked live version of ""red hot"" that i might put up soon to give hair band guys some love. motley crue can bring it live."
1516,"i put a lush song from 1990 (sweetness and light) on the gen x subreddit yesterday, and due to its popularity i decided to put a later one on here for xennials, though i realize you guys might be a tad young to remember. this is another of my favorites by them behind sweetness and light. 

i think angela chase would approve ;). enjoy!"
1518,"very popular in the genx subreddit, so i figured xennials may appreciate it as well."
1519,"""superblast"" was another of my favorites."
1520,"yes i remember that song very well, in my prime while i was on the dance floor with that song during the days with the great clubs."
1521,"you bet, i think i will give it a couple days but jesus and mary chain is on deck.

mbv, husker du, the replacements, and wire are my favorite bands of all time. echo and the bunnymen is also among my favorites, if you have a chance to see them live, take advantage. i really like lush as well, though their style did change.

whats cool is that lush covered several wire songs (and wire themselves loved their versions) and mbv covered wire with the magnificent ""map ref 41"", a case where one of my fav bands covered one of my fav bands and did it right."
1522,agreed
1523,i still like all those bands in that grouping.
1524,"out of any boundaries i've done for any generations this one has been the toughest to work out....millenials have a fit when any bit of 1995 gets taken from them, and i originally had all of 1995 for gen k but millenials convinced me that class of 2013 was theirs. this is a case where i almost say, if you think you are zillenial you are. especially since you are less than 3 months away. perhaps 3 months away and adamant about being a zillenial puts you there."
1525,"one of my favorite songs of all time (its from 1990), just feels right to me. they do an outstanding version of wire's great ""outdoor miner"" as well.  i may talk about gen jones alot, but i have a lot of appreciation for genx and the way they carried the music onward."
1526,"great song, i was right there with them when this came out. this band was greatly influenced by wire's magnificent 3rd album ""154"" (1979), which laid the groundwork for the lions share of 1980's post-punk.

but honestly when you said early depeche mode i was expecting one of their early singles like ""just can't get enough"" or ""new life"". come to think of it though 1983 was early for this long-lived band.

great call any way you look at it."
1527,"i still use cds in my 2007 car. 6 cd changer, love it."
1528,"hmmm.....i'd take ""let's get crazy"" over ""round and round"" though. both songs are dope, but purple rain is a tight album."
1529,"as much as the 1958-1964 group are separate from boomers in reality, i did grow up into my teens in the mid-70's wishing i had grown up as a hippie boomer in the middle 60's with that culture and that rich inspired late 60's music, we remember the 60's as kids and there is indeed a longing or jonesing among us that gave us that generation jones name. but alas we grew up in different circumstances as reality set in. but, that being said, loved the 1980's, that was our time to shine!

i like that you are partially standing up for gen jones also, even if its in the guise of boomers. rap and punk to jones, metal largely to boomers. as much as i rail against our older brothers the boomers they did their share of good also which is often taken for granted, and people forget the male population had the prospect of being drafted to vietnam, and not all boomers were rich enough or connected to avoid that. none of us have been faced with that.

we were the first group to come up after the boomers did the heavy lifting to combat social injustices, so our generation was the first to have women in the workforce (other than maybe ww2?) in large numbers, and we were much more racially integrated than previous generations."
1530,its his birthday today i believe....or would have been
1531,millenials are like 24-37 years old right now if i did my math right
1533,"let's not go there, early 60's born were not part of the boomer generation no matter how much they tried to convince us we were. we know better. we had nothing to do with the problems caused today either, other than sit idly by like our neighbors in gen x did. our footprint in politics is small (like gen x) unless you want to blame obama for everything wrong with the world. might have a gen jones vp if amy klobuchar or kamala harris gets there though.

and when you think about it, the first genxers are only 3 1/2 years younger than me (i was born in august), which we all know by now.....is nothing as far as time."
1534,"yes, you are right, i should have known better, i bought the album first week it was released. good call. i guess it was only a couple years between first 2 albums, seemed longer."
1535,"haha i remember belonging to that, i had to get iron butterfly's ""in  gadda da vida"" because i ran out of albums i needed that they had. what a trip. around 1977 or so i joined, about 16 years old.

a few good albums there, aerosmith - rocks and journey - infinity are probable the best albums you can get from those 2 bands if you can stomach journey. toys in the attic a close 2nd for aerosmith.

but my god a lot of awful crap in there.

looks like advert is from the early 80's since boston's ""don't look back"" is there."
1536,"great analysis and not surprising, they were often considered part of the paisley underground movement when they started in the early to mid 80's."
1537,"haha, yeah the beat goes on, we had the older people get ours too. i guess that's always been the way."
1538,"i could see that, probably hero takes a fall also on college radio."
1539,"i guess my logic was sound then by picking them over katrina here! haha, fascinating!"
1540,"i think we always got along well with gen x, certainly in music there are plenty mixed bands of both and mucho respect. michael stipe and kurt cobain for instance were good friends, i think thurston moore (sonic youth) and cobain also. bob mould seemed to get along with everyone in gen x. the surviving members of nirvana and joan jett seemed to have a bond. eddie vedder introduced rem into rock and roll hall of fame. on and on. basically, we partied together."
1541,"well, metallica is a gen jones band unless you go with the 1961-1981 definition of gen x, same with megadeth and slayer, but even then they might be jones. i'd have to check.

we weren't the group specifically called baby boomers but we were part of the baby boom, strange as it sounds. we were the 2nd big birth rate group after ww2. we were so big and varied that we were responsible for creating both sides of the coin...  many (but not all!) of the 80's hair band music (motley crue, def leppard, and uggh poison and bon jovi) and most of the ""antithesis"" bands (metallica, megadeth, slayer, and the lions share of post-punk and 80's alternative) were gen jones bands also. i have a theory about this but i don't want to get into it now.

while genx bands were highly influenced by many gen jones bands, the one area they killed in the early 90's were the hair bands with the arrival of nirvana and pearl jam. even a gen jones band like soundgarden helped put the nail in the coffin and became a major iconic band for gen x."
1543,"i like your posts but nearly all the great bands and artists of the 60's were born in what i call the rock and roll generation (1940-1945), a war babies cusper generation between silent and boomers that came of age with first generation rock and roll like elvis presley, buddy holly, chuck berry, and little richard.....the ""american graffitti"" generation. this group was the creators of all that great music , not the boomers. boomers were the consumers. the beatles, stones, the who, doors, brian wilson, hendrix, dylan, kinks et all were from this generation. they had grown up loving that first-generation rock and roll and built on it.

boomers were those that created disco (thankfully we in gen jones cut disco off right away, we hated it, and it quickly died near the beginning of the 80's), the mellow singer/songwriter early 70's music like james taylor and carly simon, glam rock like slade, sweet, queen, kiss, also fleetwood mac and the eagles stuff, arena rock like styx and journey, and the harder edged rock that american gen jones picked up on before punk....bands like aerosmith, van halen, rush, ac/dc, and boston. van halen was after punk but so mind-blowingly refreshing at the time they could not be ignored. those were created by boomers.

you are right about stevie nicks, debbie harry, and dolly parton, but don't forget the wilson sisters in heart and pat benatar. but it wasn't until gen jones stepped in that we finally got all female rock bands, i'm sure the runaways (joan jett, lita ford, cherie currie, sandy west) were probably first since they were doing it at 15 or 16."
1544,"thanks for your input, let me mull it over."
1545,i like your taste already.
1546,"when i originally had done this i had millenials ending in 1994, but millenials convinced me to move it up to at least part of 1995....it's a difficult break point.

were you born within about 2 months of the break point? remember i have sept - dec as gen k."
1547,"generation jones (1958-1964 in u.s., 1954-1964 in u.k.)

brought the founders of both amazon and netflix and the first black u.s  president (ok technically half black).

and for music

first all-girl rock bands (the runaways, the bangles, the go-gos) i believe, but i could be wrong here, there may have been others.

punk (including hardcore, boomers brought proto-punk though)

new wave (joint with boomers, talking heads and the police are  boomers, elvis costello and gary numan are jones for instance)

post-punk (most all varieties, the cure, wire, joy division/new order, the smiths, echo and the bunnymen, the rain parade, technopop like duran duran and simple minds)

alternative and college radio (rem, replacements, husker du, cocteau twins, jesus and mary chain and my bloody valentine for example)

thrash (metallica, megadeth, slayer)

rap (original old-school like grandmaster flash, ice-t, run dmc, and public enemy though gen x modernized it and brought in some of the best hip-hop artists like tupac)

i just wanted to make this clear, although gen x brought their share to the table no doubt. this might not be a popular post to make here but in defense of gen x much of the music i mentioned has gen x as the intended audience, so they are often the consumers and play a large part. basically gen jones made music for genx to consume mostly in the 1980's.

most of the bands of the latest 80's and the early to mid-90's are gen x with one important exception: soundgarden is a gen jones band, i think all or most all members were born early 60's. jeff ament, great bassist of mother love bone/pearl jam is also gen jones, but both nirvana and pearl jam are obviously x bands (so what if vedder was born a week early, he is x) in totality as are the scores of bands and artists that came out early to middle 1990's.

just the music perspective..."
1548,"yes, i tend to like their 80's work over their 90's work."
1549,"yep, for sure."
1550,spot on! and all millenials are at least 24.
1551,"hahaha, classic! and true!"
1552,"i had to look up this ""adulting"" thing, i mean seriously? this is a thing? millenials speak a different language to me, they really do, the internet went to their heads. they needed grounding in the real world. generation x and xennials i can relate to very well, but millenials? what the...."
1553,"thank you, this was well received in the zillenial subreddit a couple months ago, and they had a big hand with feedback for putting the finishing touches on it. kudos to those zillenials.

haha it also helped that my nephew was an earliest zillenial (born sept. '95) and i didn't forget sitting up with him and watching all those shows on cartoon network! dare i say it? i enjoyed some of them also!"
1554,"haha got a laugh at that one....but i'd stick with gen jones since it was made a name in 1999, finally! goomers is too close to gomers which is too close to homers!"
1555,"i would have millenials as september 1983- august 1995....they are the first generation to graduate high school in a post-9/11 world.

**1983 (9/1/83) -1995 (8/31/95) = generation y or millenials** ( *class of 2002 - class of 2013*, major generation, **12 years**), millenials are the first major generation to come of age with the pc sales boom and the wild west of the internet in the late 90's. as a result they are the first generation that could realistically use the internet as a medium for mass communication before high school. millenials are also the first generation to graduate high school *after* the tragic events of 9/11. they grew up or came of age with star wars prequels, *buffy the vampire slayer*, *dawsons creek*, *friends*, *futurama*, *daria*, netflix, steam, flip-top phones, windows 98/2000/xp, cd then dvd players, aol chatrooms and my space, pokemon, n64, dreamcast, and the 6th generation consoles (ps2, gamecube, original xbox). they remember 9/11 clearly.

with internet gaming coming to fruition and with these guys often being hardcore gamers, games as diverse as diablo 2, half-life/half-life 2, counter-strike, starcraft/brood war, world of warcraft, guild wars, unreal tournament 2004, battlefield 2, as well as console games like original halo, metroid prime, ocarina of time, soul calibur (1 and 2), wind waker, resident evil 4, super smash brothers melee, and gta: vice city and/or san andreas were often on their playlist.

***fun fact: with this model all (or nearly all, some may have dropped out) millenials in the u.s. were in 1st-12th grade during the 2001-2002 school year. so basically nearly all millenials in the u.s. were in school when 9/11 happened! it just worked out that way.***"
1556,"thanks for your feedback, zillenials gave me lot of feedback to work with, they deserve a lot of credit."
1557,"then just ignore it. i post plenty of stuff that has nothing to do with that either. but i admit i get annoyed when people lump us in with that selfish group that screwed us first and continued down the line. no way we are part of that group, all we contributed was obama, nothing to do with those born in the late 1940's. i'm standing up for our group that gets completely ignored even more than gen x, so just ignore my ramblings if they bother you. thats all you have to do. if people start to recognize us as a separate generation in earnest i will do you a favor and create a separate gen jones subreddit and not mention it here anymore. genxers would always be welcome of course, it would be heavy on mid to late 70's thru early to mid 80's."
1558,on a side note i thought that was one of the most twisted episodes of walking dead. it starts out with lizzie playing with zombies as she can't seem to register the difference between living and undead.
1559,definitely agree with you there.
1560,"i personally don't consider myself a baby boomer in any event anyways if i am honest with myself, we were always told we were but we don't fit there, we all know that, 1960-1964 really isn't part of any group (we used to be called tweeners uggh) and i don't think 1958 and 1959 are either, though '58 and '59 are more boomer-like than those born in the early 60's, but they had some future game-changers in that group that tied with the 1980's and gen x also. we are on the cusp between.

we are either a separate gen jones (1958-1964) or truly part of gen x (1961-1981 but i think 1960 belongs here also at least if that's the case).

in any event we are with you gen x, we aren't going to be wiped out either and our millions in the '60-'64 group got your back, and those millenials are getting cocky!"
1561,"yep, zillenial for sure, here's my take:

**1995 (9/1/95 on) -1999 (8/31/99)** **= generation k (katniss) or zillenials** ( *class of 2014 - class* *of 2017*, cusper generation, **4 years**) the generation born around the release of the revolutionary windows '95 operating system (and the evolutionary windows '98), these guys spent their childhood glued to the tv set for the latest episode of *powerpuff girls, dexters laboratory,* or *johnny bravo* on cartoon network but came of age in late elementary, middle and early highschool with sweeping social and technological changes as a result of smart phones, social media, and sites like youtube. their first phones were often feature (dumb) phones like the motorola razr but some in this generation got upgrades to a smart phone by high school. lcd wide-screen hdtv's, blu-ray, the nintendo wii (with its wii remote) and windows 7 were now becoming more commonplace by middle school and this generation was often impacted by tv shows like lizzie mcguire, american idol, and american horror story (later on) as well as movies like avatar and of course the hunger games. they share a love of harry potter books/movies with late 80's/90's millenials and a love for hannah montana (tend toward female) and spongebob squarepants (as kids and teens) with early to middle gen z. most zillenials were able to vote in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, and they constituted the youngest voting block. like any cusper generation they have an understanding of their border generations to a differing degree and can feel more at home with either one or the other, or just as themselves. they may or may not have memories of 9/11 but not much emotional impact at this age unless the family was directly affected. best friends sophie turner and maisie williams (sansa and arya stark from game of thrones) are from generation k, they might make good icons for this generation.

like the millenials, members of gen k were also enjoying games on the 6th generation consoles and eventually the 7th generation consoles (xbox 360, playstation 3, nintendo wii) once they reached middle or high school. in addition to games on the 6th generation consoles (listed in the millenials description) zillenials often played 7th generation games like the mass effect series (1-3), the elder scrolls series (particularly skyrim), portal (1 and 2), grand theft auto v, bioshock, call of duty 4: modern warfare and the super mario galaxy games.

***fun fact: nearly 100% of all members of generation k were in high school (u.s., 9th - 12th grade) during the 2013/2014 school year. and nearly 100% of students in high school at that time were part of generation k according to this model.***"
1562,"haha, i've been on the millenial subreddit and many of them really do think that way."
1563,yes they were! i was lucky to be at a good age thru that decade.
1564,"i completely agree, i was at an age and an area where i could soak in that early 80's goodness. most of their best work was before ""don't you"" and often times they like to distance themselves from that song anyways. i had both new gold dream and sparkle in the rain so i feel you brother.

i never considered ""don't you"" a gen x anthem.....however i would consider it and ""hungry like the wolf"" as 2 of the most iconic songs of the decade.

when i think of gen x anthem i think of sonic youths ""teenage riot"". at least on the american side."
1565,"this one takes me back, i was stationed in england in the u.s. air force in 1981-1984,  takes me back to my favorite british girlfriend.......the one that got away. great memories of england, it was a good time to be there. i will never forget.

young jim kerr here, i'm certain this concert takes place in their native scotland, images from glasgow maybe? to think everyone in that crowd is in their 50's and 60's now. but it looks like this was a fun memory for them. i was over there at that time, wish i had been there at the concert.

thought i'd bring this up to show my fellow americans that simple minds had plenty of music  before (don't you) forget about me and alive and kicking in case some genxers were too young to remember that.

this and 1982's new gold dream 81 82 83 84 are my favorite songs by simple minds. how about you guys?

molly ringwald would have stamped her seal of approval on this song."
1566,"we had the threat of nuclear war in most of the 1980's but man i loved that decade. no internet at all, but i loved it.

the mtv 80's, where they actually played music videos. and man did i have it for martha quinn!"
1567,yeah no doubt a younger girl had a crush on him as the older high school boy. that's what we'd like to believe.
1568,haha sounds about right
1569,of the 5 he was the odd person out. someone had to be and he was the youngest and male. girls usually get with older guys at that age and time. don't know about these days.
1570,one of the best movies of the 1980's........and also i'm sure one of the cheapest to make.
1571,"thanks, that makes more sense, both x and doors were la bands, and i'm sure ray stayed connected or even lived there early 80's."
1572,agreed
1573,"i can understand all of that, thanks for setting me straight and giving your perspective.i probably see the big chill as you see st. elmo's fire! cannot relate."
1574,"they were the best band of the 1960's thanks to a string of great albums beginning with face to face that still sound great today. shangri - la probably my fav. song, with waterloo sunset, days, village green preservation society, and animal farm up there.

and i am american."
1575,"always, though it was never one of my fav doors songs. it was decent, though i liked quite a few other songs off of strange days a bit better.

echo had some influence from the doors anyways and i think ray manzarek had a hand on their first album if i remember correctly. or was that x?"
1576,thats for damn sure. i'd still like to believe but its tough sometimes.
1577,thanks brother you too.
1578,"you guys are pulling out all the stops tonight, echo and the bunnymen and xtc?

xtc is an acquired taste for many, but to me skylarking is one of the 2 or 3 best albums ever made, love it, i don't know if its todd rundgrens input or andy and colins songs hitting their stride but the album is pretty much perfect, especially if you were lucky to have dear god included on it. its an album that gets better and better with repeated listenings and you never get tired of it.

ah, i see its the same person. seems our tastes match up well!"
1579,"one of the best bands of the 1980's......period. will sergeants guitar playing could be amazing.

i've seen probably at least a hundred concerts in the 1980's.

the 2nd time i saw them in philly was the best concert i have ever seen by anyone. they pulled out all the stops and played probably at least 25 of their songs, everything from rescue to the killing moon and silver. during their encore, they said the next song was coming up on their next album....that song was lips like sugar, and it was magnificent live. they were a band crying to be heard by a national audience. i swear every song i requested via shout they played, and often from their great first album crocodiles. i mean i shouted out ""all that jazz"" from crocodiles thinking no way they would play that. and whamo they got right into it, one of my favorite songs by them.

again, one of the best bands of the 1980's. girls jumped the stage for mcculluch several times but they played without a hitch.

first time i saw them was great also, they were playing with new order which is not too shabby especially since no decided to explore a little of their joy division catalogue.

oh and this song and movie are good also ;). i especially like the editing of the video.

another good candidate for this subreddit would be bring on the dancing horses with perhaps snippets from 16 candles in the video. or was it pretty in pink? one of them. i just know it was one with genxer molly."
1580,"it doesn't represent boomers at all, but gen jones definitely! we will take it off your hands happily. to be honest the more i think about it the movie has a 1980/1981 school year feel like freaks and geeks, where the oldest are gen jones and the youngest are gen x. that feels about right. 

high school in the late 1960's is different than high school early 1980's. we were not boomers, we did not have vietnam and woodstock on our minds, but we did actually have finding a job on our mind after the boomers took the jobs and we were competing with them and the millions of our own group for jobs in a saturated market! no wonder we partied so hard in high school. like the red-head in dazed and confused said, the 70's sucked, but we would be in our 20's in the 80's and it might turn out to be good ....and indeed most of us ended up doing well despite the 80's  recessions in our path."
1581,looks like the boomers are the cool ones in that pic haha....jeff bridges is the dude.
1582,"st. elmos fire and 3/5ths of breakfast club were gen jones, not boomers.

boomers were the big chill, and i couldn't get into that one either. if i were a boomer i suppose that should have been an easy one to get into, but it didn't speak to me. only interesting thing to me in that movie was meg tilly......ooooh da sexy! in fact meg tilly was the only gen jonser in that movie, the others were all boomers. she was just the young fling of the guy that died. meg was still in college when she got the part. phoebe cates, another lovely gen joneser had applied for that part, and though she didn't get it, she met future husband kevin kline on the set.

i don't understand the hate for gen jones,  we were integral to gen x pop culture growing up and we had a major hand in the grunge movement. we are closely tied together.

....and we were nothing like the boomers of the 60's (especially those of us born in the 1960's) other than the hair and some love for the late 60's music we remembered as wide-eyed kids, we took the high volume classic rock  and punk of the late 1970's and created alot of new and interesting music in the 1980's (for instance thrash bands like metallica, megadeth, and slayer) that was picked up and influential to gen x bands, not to mention post-punk and alternative. and you guys grew up with our guys as your icons, usually one generation influences the next.

but oh well. or as you guys say, whatever."
1583,"sean penn as spiccoli could represent gen jones in these pics,  thought about keanu reeves for gen jones, but nothing beats bob odenkirk as saul goodman. i've always felt gen jones was like bob odenkirks jimmie (saul) to boomers michael mckeans chuck, overshadowed and less pompous but perhaps sharper. so bob odenkirk for jones it is.

neither penn or reeves are members of gen x anyway.

how about the dude who starred with reeves in bill and teds, i think he's gen x.

haha don't use carrot top though.

or charlie sheen in one of his movies or when he was with those 2 porn girls or something from 2.5 men? has to be something there.

or even mathew mcconaghey?"
1585,"ah ok fair enough then. i don't agree with it, but so be  it."
1586,"you should, it's a very good show."
1587,"boomer generation is 12 years, same as silent, gen x, and millenial

boomers = 1946-1957 (major)

generation jones = 1958-1964 (cusper)

generation x = 1965-1976 (major)

oregon trail generation = 1977- august 1983 (cusper)

millenials = september 1983 - august 1995 (major)

no generation can last 20 years and have kids of the same generation. they have nothing in common if they are 20 years apart either. 12 is appropriate."
1588,"oh wow, you completely removed xennials, unless of course you don't believe in cuspers.

i'm sticking with september 1983 - august 1995 for millenials, a cool 12 years and not too long for the beginning of the generation to have nothing in common with the end.

this places millenials as the first generation to graduate high school post 9/11 and the last millenials born around the time of windows '95.

by coincidence there's nothing better than the number 12 anyways, you can divide the generation nicely still further in 3 or 4 for those so inclined.

also, with this model pretty much every american millenial was in school grades 1-12th in the 2001/2002 school year all bearing witness to the 9/11 attack....feels poetic."
1589,"i did a detailed analysis of each generation and came up with these dates concerning millenials:

oregon trail generation (ot generation or xennials) = 1977- august 1983, cusper generation, 6.5 + years, the last generation to graduate high school prior to 9/11

millenials (generation y) = september 1983 - august 1995, major generation, 12 years, the first generation to graduate high school post 9/11

zillenials (generation k [katniss]) = september 1995 - august 1999, cusper generation, 4 years"
1590,"i'd say xennials are 36-43 right now

millenials are 24-36 

zillenials are 20-24

gen zers are 9-20"
1591,"great show and iconic for xennials especially. it came out the year before windows '95 if i remember correctly.

they made the mistake of putting it up against friends, and claire wanted to do movies after anyways. she was pretty irreplaceable in the role."
1592,"thats a pretty poor analysis, you do realize that all of soundgarden, 2 key members of pearl jam, 3 of the 4 members of rem, all of husker du, the replacements, the runaways, thurston moore, and courtney love are members of generation jones right? you don't think any of them had a d.i.y. attitude? they are all boomers? what about grandmaster flash, ice-t and public enemy, were some of the most important early rappers boomers also? jello biafra and henry rollins? 90% of the iconic core brat pack? and thats just the american side and the tip of the iceberg. we were into the punk movement (which led to grunge) before gen x reached middle school. many of us were doing the things gen x takes credit for before they were. mtv etc. was right in our wheelhouse just like gen x. that is a shared experience as is the early part of the golden age of arcade gaming. this isn't a slight on gen x, i generally like genxers, i count many as friends.....it just would be nice to get the recognition we deserve. we are a generation between, neither boomer nor x (especially the 1960-1964 group). you can think those born in the latest 50's are more boomer-like, but other than the birth-rate numbers we in the early 60's were not. its mostly individual when it comes to 1958-1964, and especially 1960-1964 because gen jones is a cusper transitional generation. but just like the oregon trail generation on the other side it is real.

your 2nd paragraph makes no sense, while i personally would like to see many of the ideas sanders talks about come to fruition, we know realistically it isn't going to happen at this time. how are those ideas going to pass through congress at this time? and sanders people can't even be bothered to vote for him against biden, so how is he going to beat the ""orange overlord""? it doesn't look like trump supporters are going to budge at all. be open-minded about things. but alas i don't want to stain this subreddit with politics.

i have never been a boomer and neither have my friends in the '60-'64 born range. that '46-'64 range is held by birth rate only and not by how we are. we aren't x either as i have said over and over, but we are somewhere in between.....which side depends on the individual, not anyones desire to push everyone in there as boomers because their siblings lean one way or another. cusper generations can lean either way or be comfortable as their own."
1594,"i still say the most forgotten group is the 1958-1964 group, we were casually lumped in with boomers though we have none of the life experiences and markers they had. ours was different we don't even have the same generation of parents most of the time, boomers had ""greatest"", we had silent.

imagine being lumped in with this bunch of self-serving group when the only major politician we contributed was president obama. i like to think we are generally more open-minded than the boomers partially because we were the first generation to grow up in a decidedly more integrated society. i want to see biden pick amy klobuchar as his running mate. i think she would do well as president if something happens to biden (assuming he beats trump).

we were overlooked so far as well as gen x."
1595,absolutely! brilliant dude...and as usual brilliant skit.
1596,thanks and you too.
1597,"yes, i apologize about that, sounds like you are doing the right things. your statements are sound and sensible, and my reply was probably more directed at the person who wishes the virus to wipe out an entire generation."
1598,they do end in august 1995
1599,"no no no

boomers = 1946-1957 (u.s., 12 years)

generation jones = 1958-1964 (u.s., 7 years)

generation x = 1965-1976 (12 years)

oregon trail generation = 1977- august, 1983 (last generation to grad h.s. before 9/11, 6.5 + years)

millenials = sept 1983 - august 1995 (12 years)

zillenials = sept 1995 - august 1999 (4 years)

gen z = sept 1999 - ? (probably about 12 years)"
1600,i took my masters online. maybe cuz bbn it was masters instead of undergrad. a lot more focused and people who actually participated and worked hard on group assignments. less hassle with parking and administration. it was hard to find time to meet for feoup projects though because of people  living so distantly. ae mostly did our own parts of the projects then put them together and edited from there.

1602,i was very into shoegaze back in the day. saw mbv in concert. they were into the show and had great stage performance. same with dinosaur jr who performed at that mbv show also.
1603,the rest of the bands that night were very good. but jmc headlined so that's how the night ended.. curve blew them away.
1604,one of the worst live acts i ever saw. they were so wooden and uninterested in performing and i think they were arguing with each other on stage at points.
1605,so is it a vertical toss then?
1606,is it a horizontal toss then? a 45 degree toss?
1607,quick answer...with your hands

1615,it was only on one season if i recall correctly
1616,watch videos of the guard(s) you're interested in. look at their social media. see what they do. copy them. if you dont know how to do something ask. performers are all over social media too and are usually super willing to help people who are interested in being on their team.
1617,"yes you should expect to at least try weapon. the instructors want to see what you're willing to try and how hard your willing to work with something you've never experienced before. who knows there could be an equipment exchange where you're on weapon for 8 counts during the show or something like that. 

we've actually put people on weapon because they had ""the look"" we wanted for that section of show. they didn't toss at all or if they did it wasn't a crazy difficult toss. and they were off weapon as quickly as possible but it happened."
1618,"obviously ops daughter or son or whatever doesn't
 congrats to you."
1619,yup. but as voices not himself well except maybe haunted castle or whatever i don't know that one. still not likely to be known by a 15 and 22 year old.
1620,yeah whatever flubber was in the movie. move on.
1621,"look at it from the perspective of gen x. it's definitely about gen x characters, except maybe the cheating guy and his wife but at the time the movie was made i assumed them to be aged late 40s early 50s which would put them as early gen x"
1622,like what pop culture references from the past 22 years involve any of those names? nothing to be depressed about. present them with the info and the references. then they'll know them.
1623,"grosse point blank

edit:

1624,why would they already know them if you're just introducing them? not to mention the fact none of the names you mentioned have made a movie your kids would be interested in during their lifetimes. except maybe eddy murphy with the flubber films.

1701,"yup, i've been thinking the same thing."
1702,"i’m gonna disagree with the popular opinion on here. i think as long as you and your boyfriend aren’t interacting with a lot of people - social distancing for errands and no friends or other family visit - then i think you can spend time together. right before this all started you were physically around each other so much that you were basically members of each others’ households anyway. 

but you will have to be careful. if your boyfriend’s household has people who are not following social distancing, they could pass it to him and then he to you and then you to your grandparents, etc. so if you decide to do this you’ll have to have very strong trust with everyone involved.  also to be extra safe spend time with him in a room away from your grandparents, and sanitize everything (and shower) after his visits."

most people carry little tissue packets everywhere so they'll have tissue to wipe with when out and about, but i suppose you do have to use your hand occasionally. i certainly met quite a few locals and foreigners who \*never\* carried tissues and i was too grossed out to ask what they did...

the thing is, i'm pretty sure that when i set up the chinese paypal, i had to verify my chinese phone number with a code sent via text message. one way you could get around that (which worked fine for me in 2018), is to give chinese paypal a chinese friend's number and then the friend sends you the code. that might work for your bank account issue as well. anyway best of luck :)"

i triple washed everything, using both soap and a special vegetable disinfectant wash imported from australia.  didn't make a bloody difference.

it's not just the tainted meat, wild animals, etc. in china, chickens and other animals roam freely around the fields pooping on all the crops and no one cares and nothing is ever tested and there is no quality control. there are laws and government agencies, but they don't bother to do their jobs because having horrible digestion is so normal there that no one even realizes how sick everyone is all the time. most of my chinese friends were constantly taking some kind of herbal remedy for diarrhea. it was a crazy place.

i've been back in the u.s. for over a year now and i still do a happy dance every time the fruits and vegetables don't make me sick. also i've been eating mountains of fruits and vegetables since i got back. because i can :-)

p.s. gotta give some love to mexico - i lived there for six months and the produce was freaking perfect the entire time. even the stuff i'd buy off street vendors was clean and yummy and amazing. living vegan in mexico is fantastic, seriously :)"
1738,"i absolutely loved *the three body problem*, but i am having a hard time getting into *the dark forest*. i think it has to do with the change in translators. the translator for books 1 and 3 is a novelist, while the translator for book 2 is a businessman. you can really see the difference in style/tone/diction/etc. also i gotta admit i'm getting tired of all the men in book 2. book 1 had quite a few fantastic female characters and so far (with the exception of the first few pages), book 2 is just all men all the time. i lived in china for a couple years not too long ago and it's an extremely misogynistic country, so i do find chinese women's stories to be a lot more interesting than the men's."
1739,"english first is a huge company, so i'll give you the best advice i got before i moved to china (i lived in guangzhou from 2016-2018).

talk to current ef teachers living and working in china \*right now\*. ask them about their living conditions, commute, and rate of pay. ask about the workload and training. ask about how they feel about their managers and coworkers. it's very easy to find current ef employees, as i said it's a huge company. also, while it might be weird in the west, in china it's perfectly normal to ask the company for contact info for its employees, so if you ask ef directly for contact info of a few of their current teachers, i'm sure they'd be happy to provide you with that information.

best of luck!"
1740,"ugh i’m so sorry you got caught up in all this. i spent all of chinese new year 2018 in my apartment in guangzhou. it was so blissfully quiet i just spent the whole time cooking and studying spanish. by the end of the 30 days i could comfortably read novels in spanish, and my dumplings were off the chain. 

i hope you get to your peace and quiet soon. i’m back in the us now and working toward my spanish translator certification. there is a life post-china, but i have a feeling you’re already working towards that :)"
1741,"amazon just publicly stated that they're not airing seasons 2 or 3. if there's a way to view sky atlantic outside of the u.k. i don't know about it, so... afaik  it's pirate waters or nothing :("
1742,britannia is great. it’s a british show on amazon prime. fantasy genre but also a great romp though the second roman invasion of britain.
1743,"growing up in downtown los angeles in the 80s meant that my neighbors were from latin america and/or ukraine, my schoolmates at the charter school i attended were african-american, and the charter school itself was in a korean neighborhood that had so little english signage we all had to learn basic korean  just to figure out which stores sold socks and which stores sold candy.  all of the adults wore bell bottoms and were obsessed with disco and saturday night fever. in middle school i moved to the neighborhood where all the iranians lived (largest concentration of iranians outside of iran itself), which is how i developed a love of persian cuisine and culture that continues to this day.

so like i said, pretty much the ""hey ladies"" music video... although now that i think of it, i'm not quite sure that there were any ukrainians in the video :) 

also funny that the part of l.a. where i grew up was modeled after brooklyn..."
1744,"i may be old, but i love music. i spend a lot of time these days listening to local college radio. i live out in the 'burbs now so my local stations are claremont college and university of california riverside. both stations play really interesting, new music in a variety of genres, so i continue to further my music education. otherwise i'll just end up in a dark room playing the ""automatic for the people"" album over and over again :-)"
1745,"i know this sounds odd, but growing up in inner city los angeles in the 70s/80s, this video is a near-perfect depiction of my childhood. later on when i lived in boston (1996-7), i hung out with a band called firepig. they hosted beastie boys all-night dance parties every weekend. when this song came on, everyone just.went.wild. 

oh and i saw the beastie boys with run dmc waaaay back in 1986. my first live concert (at age 14!). 

i honestly feel bad for teenagers these days. do they have anything close to the sheer beauty and wonder of the beastie boys and groups like them? sadly, i don't think so. there's just an \*exuberance\* that's missing from music now..."
1746,sail the seven seas.... it’s not available any other way in the us.
1747,"i lived in guangzhou for two years. there’s definitely a class system there. the poor people are basically batshit insane, and the rich people constantly try to prove to you that they’re not batshit insane like the poor people. 

as for manners - yup, poop everywhere. train stations, restaurants, airports, city streets, etc. i had a running joke that all floors were “lava” cuz you dare not put your bag or your jacket on any floor or ground for any reason. i didn’t care about the bottom of my backpack, as it was reinforced, but it was hilarious to watch my friends wince in horror when i would put my backpack down :)

as for going into other people’s homes - yeah that’s a thing too. my neighbors would just show up and not leave, even when asked directly to get the eff out. conversely, they’d leave their doors open all day long and the few times i had to go to see them they didn’t seem to mind me just waltzing through the open door (and trying not to trip on all their random crap and trash strewn everywhere).  seriously, they had cabinets and drawers but never seemed to put things in them...

the one thing i never understood was the no making beds thing. rich or poor, chinese people never made their beds. the rich ones might put the blankets away each morning so the mattress with just the fitted sheet would be there, but that was as close to a made bed as i ever saw. i’m one of those weirdos who likes to make their bed nicely every morning with a pretty bedspread/blanket and pillows. i’m sure all my chinese friends thought i was insane. 

getting back to weird stuff in public - i don’t hear about it much in this sub but in guangzhou people vomit in the streets whenever they need to like it’s no big deal. no rushing for a bathroom, no shame. just throw up where you stand and keep on walking."
1748,i lived in guangzhou for two years. the pictures you posted is how my neighbors' apartments looked \*all the time\*. i was honestly dumbfounded at how they lived that way.
1749,"i tried out the trader joe’s extra firm organic tofu today after hearing about its awesomeness from someone else on reddit. drained the water overnight, then marinated it in some delicious panda express orange sauce (who knew they sold bottles of that?) fried it up this morning and yum! plus afterward i had a pretty intense energy burst. i’m new to tofu and still fascinated by how you drain out the water, then let it soak up the marinade. it’s a freaking edible sponge which for some reason i find both hilarious and delicious."
1750,"hahaha i tried a new tofu recipe this morning and it gave me such amazing energy (thanks to 50 grams soy protein), that i biked three miles, stopped at a cafe, ignored the coffee and then studied for two hours straight. all on five hours’ sleep. go 2020!"
1751,"i signed up for school five minutes before midnight last night (the last moments of 2019!), so my resolutions are fairly mundane, but important to me:

1. cook more tofu
2. walk or bike at least one mile/day (even during the scorching ie summer)
3. get straight as at school

okay i’m off to cook some tofu for breakfast now, then a walk, and then... studying!!! woohoo! 2020 is going to be an excellent year. good luck to all of you with your resolutions, and peace."

1756,"the #3 santa monica blue bus stops at lmu (in front of university hall), and goes up and down lincoln blvd. you can get off it at venice blvd. and walk to the beach (not too far), or take another bus (mta 33) down venice blvd. to venice beach. both buses run pretty often and both also have express service.

playa del rey is a little more tricky - there is at least one mta bus that goes there but i'm not sure how close it stops to lmu, or how frequently it runs. i've walked from lmu to playa del rey and it was a good-size hike, but fun if you walk along the ballona creek path. many many bunnies :)

when i went to lmu i lived mid-way between playa del rey and lmu and it was prefect. 30 minute walk to either school or the beach, and the area is really beautiful."
1757,"when i was a student at lmu, sodexo  was the bane of my existence. their prices were so insanely high for  \*everything\* i almost fainted from hunger when i forgot to bring food to  school. example: the cheapest thing you could buy was $5. period. and  i'm pretty sure that was a bagel with butter.

i  had 12-14 hour days (worked full time on campus + full time course  schedule), so i never had any time to walk the 20-30 minutes off campus  to find lower priced options (and in that neighborhood, there weren't  many).

the whole time i was going  broke trying to eat enough calories to function the sodexo workers were  getting underpaid + lousy benefits for the jobs they were doing. it was  just a shit show all around and i'm proud that they're striking/fighting  for their rights, but i'm also hella mad at sodexo for canceling  negotiations right before the debates, thus forcing the candidates to  cross a picket line. they're doing this on purpose to make the striking  workers look bad and i never thought i could hate them more but now...  ugh.

yeah it sucks that los  angeles might not have a democratic debate, but i'm okay with it if it  means that the workers finally get the wages and benefits they rightly  deserve.

/rant"
1758,"this happened to me at least once a week the entire time i drove a car in los angeles. and my dents/scratches weren't even that big or bothersome to me. but it was freaking \*constant\*. on the freeway, in parking lots, at work - pretty much everywhere i went some random guy would ask to fix my car. eventually i sold the car (dents, scratches and all), for a decent price and switched to biking/public transit. i'm in much better shape and a much happier person now :-)"
1760,"well she and i have remained good friends looong after i divorced her son, so yeah like most friendships after 30+ years of knowing each other we've influenced each other in all sorts of ways. and even though we came from very different backgrounds, she was always very welcoming and sweet to me. as for her shopping habits, i'm not sure where she shops now - she's getting up in years and doesn't like to drive so i think (like most people) it's all about amazon now."
1761,"during my brief stint married to a guy whose family were pacific palisades multi-millionaires, i can tell you that rich people \*do\* shop in these stores - because they don't shop anywhere else. my mother-in-law used to take me to those stores and loved to get decorations and clothes, gifts, etc. then i took her to the big lots in culver city one day... and she literally went into shock. like she was a frozen statue staring at the prices. she kept repeating over and over that she couldn't believe any of it was real. it was absolutely hilarious."
1762,"i've taken the 11:30pm metrolink from union station to san bernardino depot a few times. very safe both at union station and at san bernardino. lots of security guards, plus both stations have designated uber pickup spots that have a ton of security patrolling right where you meet your ride. also i'm pretty sure there's a 9:49pm train from union station if you don't want to wait until 11:30pm."
1764,"metrolink app. download it, buy a ticket on it, show the ticket (which is on your phone screen), when you board the bus. so if you own a smartphone, you have the ""ticket"" on there. no paper anything needed :)"
1765,when i lived in milan 30 years ago it was a “buhhh” sound.
1766,"i realize this is completely out of left field, but i've long held onto the notion that one of the over-arching themes of the show is that god is a woman. the constant eggs are literal ""easter eggs"" pointing viewers in this direction, as easter was a fertility festival celebrating various female goddesses of fertility (which one depended on where you were in the world), before it got co-opted by christianity.

in ""she was killed by space junk,"" you could easily interpret the joke to mean that god is a woman. there are two ways to do this:

1. in the joke, god is killed by the brick, which could be ""space junk"". so the god in the joke is a woman. yes, laurie uses the ""he"" pronoun, but she might not realize the truth of this yet, and calling god ""him"" is the most conventional way to refer to divinity in our society.
2. in the joke, after all of the heroes \*and\* god is killed, only the girl is left. presumably she takes god's place, or (most likely) she was there before him so she was always a goddess - always present and more powerful than him, he just didn't notice her before it was too late. this interpretation also foreshadows the possibility that dr. manhattan knows that god is a woman, and that's why he tells angela to ""watch the eggs"".

lady trieu has a female-only space where we have only seen one man enter - will reeves. and when he is in that space, he is able to walk, which points to special powers of regeneration only possible in a place of feminine power.

there are many other examples of eggs linking to fertility - the clark family. will eating eggs as angela learns more about her family, etc.

my favorite mention of eggs is when dr. manhattan points out that eggs and chickens must appear at the same time because one cannot come before the other, which is another way to say that you can't have a god without a goddess. or that you can't have fertility without a mother. either way,  god (or at least one of them), is a woman.

anyway, that's my two cents about the eggs. curious to hear others' thoughts. peace :)"
1767,"i was trying to figure out a way to cook them quickly so they wouldn’t go bad, and i’m not a great cook so i was looking for advice... which is why i tagged my post with the flair “advice”. as you have no advice to offer... well, peace be with you and all that :)"
1768,"i finally got around to making these, and i was blown away by how good they were. they taste exactly like dark meat chicken; it’s positively creepy. granted, i haven’t eaten meat in almost a decade, but these are by far the best “fake meat” substitutes i’ve ever made at home. here’s how i cooked them:

defrosted 1/3 of the package overnight in the fridge, then sautéed them (turning frequently), with some olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. they browned up nicely and the taste was *amazing.* i think my biggest pet peeve with fake meat substitutes is that they’re always supposed to be cooked from a frozen state, so it was nice that i was able to thaw these out before cooking. i do think that it makes a difference in texture and flavor."
1769,"i already chopped up the carrots and some of the broccoli for a curry i made yesterday. it was my first time making curry and it was far from perfect, but you know, trial and error and all that :) today i’m gonna roast the broccoli and cauliflower.  my roommate wants to eat the cucumber raw and i’m still not sure what to do with the snap peas, so they’ll probably be a side dish tonight or tomorrow."
1770,"i did make a vegan dip to go with the veggies, but the kids decided to use that dip for one of the meat options another kid brought."
1771,"hahaha i’m demolishing them this weekend, they’re one of my favorites as well."
1772,there was a vegan “ranch” dip i made for this veggie tray that didn’t make it back; apparently they used it for some chicken wings another kid brought 🙁
1773,yup that’s what i’m making for lunch today.  haven’t tried roasting vegetables before so i’m gonna try out some instructions i found online - 450 degrees for 10-15 minutes.
1775,"i absolutely love this show, but i am becoming very skeptical of a season 2 release on amazon prime anytime soon. latest info is basically no info: amazon had promised a november release date \*and then reneged on that promise\*. from what i've read, amazon is hesitant to purchase it because they don't think it's getting high enough ratings in the uk. i'm guessing (at this point), they think it's too expensive. perhaps it will come out eventually, but as i keep hearing that season 2 is better than season 1 (and i love season 1!), i've given up on ""eventually"" and i've decided to sail p\*\*\*e infested waters instead. my best estimate is that they will purchase season 2 sometime within the next 12 months, as the price will have gone down considerably within a year's time."

1778,we’re all going to reseda to die...
1779,"i love orlando bloom and i'm definitely a fan of the faiere-fantasy genre, but i had to stop watching after two episodes. that show is absolutely awful/unwatchable. it's a shame, really. i would say if you like that type of murder-mystery with corsets and watches on chains type thing the alienist is fantastic, although it doesn't have any supernatural elements."
1780,"i still watch ""misfits of science"" from time to time. that show really holds up. plus, it has courtney cox in her springsteen-dancing-girl years :-)"
1781,"it was great fun! just remember to bring snow gloves. we didn't have any so we had to share the one pair we had. made for a very awkward (but still fun), snowball fight :)"
1782,"haha there were many, many cheaters. i saw them and i saw at least 4 different chp units, but alas, i did not see the chp guys *actually catch* any of the cheaters...

the funniest part was the gas station at the 15/138. not difficult to get gas, but the line for the bathroom was at least 60-70 people long and wound all the way around the store *twice* (up and down both aisles), and right up against the front door... so strange when you consider that there are tons of places to pull over for the bathroom on the 15..."
1783,"haha i had to search around the house for where the cat had hid it last. found it and read the label. yup, it's a pusheen. good eye :-)"
1784,"unfortunately, the drive back was sheer hell. took \*two hours\* to get from wrightwood to redlands (normally takes 45 minutes).  not sure why the 138 between the 2 and the 15 was a parking lot, but... what can you do? tic (this is california)."
1785,"omg coconut curry that sounds delicious! now i must google that and make it, like, soon. if you have a recipe to share, i’d be much obliged :)"
1786,"i always do a special solo hike and meditation on thanksgiving, but this year the weather was so brutal i couldn’t even stand in the backyard for more than five minutes. i had a ton of chores to do, so i cleaned the entire house, did five loads of laundry (including all the bedding), and “feasted” on a soy protein smoothie with pineapple, with a side of leftover vegan vietnamese summer rolls from the local thai place (raw veggies, tofu, peanuts). finished it all off with a vegan instant cup o noodles and a nap. worst thanksgiving ever, but i did get to read a good novel and today the weather was perfect so i got to do my special solo hike after all, just one day later. 

i haven’t done the family thanksgiving thing since i was a kid. thanksgiving is always my special “me” time, and i guess this year that meant chores 🤷‍♀️"
1787,"49 days here. and yes! faith + not one toke is keeping me sane. congrats to you, we can do this!"
1788," day 49 for me.  cravings still happen but the intensity like you said is much lower. i can usually distract myself out of them. i find the distraction of work to be super helpful, along with forcing myself into daily healthy habits like diet, exercise, reading, etc. 

also my late grandfather was named george. and i think he’d be proud of both of us right now. good luck and stay strong :) peace."
1789,"my best friend in china was born there. then he got out the minute he graduated high school and moved to guangzhou. because of the absolutely hideous air pollution. he went on to have a nice career, beautiful wife, two kids... 

i mean, go there if you want, but you’ve been warned. if you *must* move to china (and really can anyone be talked out of it?), at least look for jobs in the cities with breathable air.  best of luck :)"
1790,"i'm a huge fan of this movie - i watch it every couple years, and i've spent a decent amount of time in santa clarita (grew up in los angeles). when the shooting happened i felt like the high school was intensely familiar, but i thought it was from driving by it or something... now i can put it all together - i knew they filmed in the area, but hadn't realized until now that it was saugus high school. thanks for the connection :)"
1791,"everyone was named mike. i knew at least 12 mikes in high school. (class of 1990). now when i need to park illegally in los angeles, i choose a private business' lot (that's closed, ofc), and i just put a note on the car that says ""parking approved by mike"" with my phone number. it's worked for years; no one calls the number, because everyone old enough with the authority to call a tow truck knows \*someone\* named mike."
1792,"i saw run dmc and beastie boys in concert at the greek theatre in los angeles when i was 14... there were girls in cages, and after both groups played seperately they tried to play together for a kind of finale at the end and it was an \*absolute disaster\* still one of the best concerts i've ever been to, and i've worn out my own cassette tapes ever since :)"
1793,burgundy or red.
1794,"my atheist grandfather’s idea of a christmas tradition was to have us watch “santa claus conquers the martians” together when it would come on during the christmas season on ktla-5 in los angeles. it was part of the family film festival in the 80s. snow white and the three stooges (snow white was a champion figure skater in that version), was also a yearly staple. anyway, i grew up adoring dropo, neemah, and those two bratty kids (the girl was pia zadora i think), quite unironically until mst 3k became all the rage during my college years. i tried to explain my deep adoration for the movie, but my friends just wanted to mock it. sigh. 

47 year old me still has the santa claus conquers the martians poster in my room. dropo looks like he’s doing a pirouette and the robot looks like he’s having a panic attack.

okay yeah i need to search up the mst3k version on youtube now. thanks for the memories!"
1795,"at the end of the joke, god goes to hell because of the ""girl with the brick""

girl with the brick == space junk that unexpectedly falls out of the sky.

god == killed by space junk.

god is a woman."
1796,"i am obsessed with c2c right now and you've just given me another great idea for one. thanks so much, and yes it's a \*gorgeous\* blanket! well done :)"
1797,"i replied to this question above, let me know if you need to know anything else."
1798,"first of all, i'm a marijuana addict. a huge one. i can't speak to your parents' use but i can say for sure that anyone raised by an addict is going to have issues. the thing is, when you're in active addiction, which for me was smoking as much as 1/4 oz \*a day\*, you lie to yourself that you're a better parent when you're high, you're more patient, more loving, etc. 

also, you have (what the 12-steppers call), the ""fantasy of functionality"". i thought i was doing fine as a parent until i got sober. now i'm starting to realize how much of a ""parent"" my kid has had to be for me these last few years, and its just heartbreaking to see how much i've made her grow up so fast, and how her ""parenting"" of me has caused her to fall behind her peers in a lot of areas, but especially socially/emotionally. she also has severe panic disorder, which yes i'm sure she was born with, but while i was in active addiction i chose a pretty shitty therapist for her who probably made her panic disorder worse, and it goes on and on...  

the bottom line is that when i was in active addiction, marijuana was the most important thing in my life. period. now that i'm sober, my daughter is the most important thing in my life, and i pray to the goddess every day that i never smoke again, because i lost so much time with her... and i'll never be able to get it back.

hope this explains things a little better, and peace."
1799,"take it from a parent of a (now) 15 year old: kids are triggering as fuck. it will not be easy to stay away from weed as this little baby will do nothing but change for the next three-plus decades. but stay strong! one of my biggest regrets as a parent is how much i smoked. even if the kid doesn't know that you smoke (mine didn't), weed will seriously impact your ability to be a good parent. take it from someone who wishes that they could turn back the clock and be sober for so... freaking... much. i'm now 43 days sober and doing my best to fix the damage i did to my relationship with my kid. thank the goddess her other parent doesn't smoke/drink/do drugs or i can't imagine what an absolute mess she'd be right now (and to be fair, she's not where she should be at her age, mostly due to my weed use).

anyway, just my two cents. you got this!"
1800,"""10 years ago"" was a lame joke. i apologize. i don't want it to be thirty years ago."
1801,"well i'm definitely curious because the last time i saw them perform was in 1990 (ten years ago). that was good btw - and very, very loud."

1818,"well ya, but when you look up ""le wrong generation"", you find definitions like *""a term used to ridicule people who believe they were 'born in the wrong generation' just because they listen to classic rock, play old video games, watch television shows/movies released before they were born""* or *""a pejorative label used to refer to youths and young adults who believe and often proclaim that they should have been born in a different time period, mainly due to their disdain for contemporary music and popular culture.""* i interpreted the posted image as coming from an older person whining about 'kids these days' and prefering their own generation."

1857,will confirm. vanilla game. barbed wire fences are (for reasons?)  one way. easy to get trapped this way (happened to me in the prison). don't get it.
1858,you pre-emptively stole my reply. have some disputed coloured arrow.

1862,"die brücke! very reminiscent of early german expressionist lino/woodcuts (i'm sure that is no coincidence).

nice."
1863,every detail is perfect.
1864,cake day!
1865,good bot.
1866,"quitting and reloading could have worked. cars are sometimes sort of dropped from the sky when you load the game. random collision might have moved them just enough so he could move or enter a car.

edit: watched the whole end of the stream in the meantime and reloading is what he tried first... but unfortunately it didn't work. 2 months and 26 days... ouch."
1867,"that is an absolute rip-off. well depends on where you live, i guess. big mac index. a big mac costs € 3,80 here.  about the same as those chocolates in a mid-price supermarket."
1868,"i was doubtful when you mentioned aldi, because raffaello is a brand product (from ferrero) and aldi usually doesn't carry those... but you were right. and they are (aldi here) a euro cheaper than the price i mentioned before. interesting."
1869,"i'm sorry for you. raffaellos are definitely not expensive chocolates though. that exact same box costs € 3,72 in my local supermarket (belgium)."
1870,"i like the logo, but it also makes me laugh because of the eye. grumpy griffin. in case that is not what you wanted: have you tried using a plain white disc for the eye? might give it a more neutral appearance. 

also somehow makes me think of a bank. but no idea where that connection comes from."
1871,"i think you will still see it on your profile, but others won't. good luck."
1872,yes. my first thought too. all analogues can easily get dull and flat. make something pop. i still like it though.
1874,good bot.
1875,nice
1876,is that poseidon?
1877,"ban is permanent, but the blemish on your profile goes away after 7 years.

1881,best piggyback.
1882,ouindeau.
1883,"quick first impression: too many different diagonal directions. leading lines that crash into one another and cause unrest (the top right triangle looks completely random). the circle with the big g is trapped in a corner.  try  align the other circle 's center with the top of the green rectangle (either by scaling or moving). your text sometimes feels crammed in the surrounding shapes (""bold"", ""eric gill""). the diagonal lines in the top left part of the poster aren't parallel and it's driving me crazy. that looks more like sloppy execution than a deliberate design choice.

it's a personal opinion.

i don't want to discourage you. i think you can make this work, but you need to bring more structure and balance to your composition. well, either that or go a lot more crazy."
1884,"i love sir terry, but no, not even him."
1885,"when i was in high school, woodstock was an ancient hippie thing from my parents' generation. it took place 20 years before i graduated. my own graduation is now over 30 years ago...

kids now look at our childhood years like we looked at the fifties (elvis, poodle skirts, diners & drive-ins).

best not to think about it."

1888,there's some varys from game of thrones in there too.
1889,or the other way around: tone down the hard black outlines of the illustration some to match the text better. give it a slightly more washed appearance.
1890,good point.
1891,not even necessary: set your foreground colour to black and your background to white (the default colours); open your filter gallery (menu filter > filter gallery); choose sketch > halftone pattern; set pattern type to dot; set contrast slider to max and play around with the size slider (depends on size of original picture).

1901,"i saw them live at lollapalooza 2 in new orleans! i look back at that now and realize what an amazing lineup that was. my internet has slowed down to a crawl tonight and i can't really get a search done, but from what i can recall, there was jesus and mary chain, ministry, red hot chili peppers, pearl jam, soundgarden, ice cube, lush... totally bananas."
1902,"when my dog was a puppy he jumped up and knocked a nearby mug of coffee into the air and onto a fairly new macbook pro. it was not a good day, but it's not like i could be mad at him. he was just doing puppy stuff."
1903,"did she poop her pants in college, too?"
1904,you pooped in the refrigerator? and you ate the whole... wheel of cheese?
1905,want a balloon?
1906,"back in college i worked at a music store (think fye when it used to sell cds and tapes) at the mall. there was a semi-regular mystery customer who hid index cards around the store that sported hand-written phrases like ""sweet pie jesus"" and ""call jesus"" on them in black magic marker. sometimes i found them shoved in weird places around town, too. i always wished that i had caught the guy who did it just to see what he'd say. i'm assuming it was a guy. definitely a guy's handwriting: big, bold block letters."
1907,i keep them when i find them and then leave them on the bed in our guest bedroom to annoy visitors.

1910,"americans can have a little universal basic income, as a treat."
1911,i read this in jimmy magill’s voice. worked perfectly.
1912,"i’m not good at this kind of verbal switcheroo, but if you get stopped and then refuse to speak to them you might get to watch all of that cop bluster turn into a full-on and completely ineffectual temper tantrum. they do not like it if you know your rights and refuse to buckle. i’ve only done it once, and it was because i was in an exceptionally bad mood when i was pulled over for “going too fast” in a parking garage on state property. how fast? “too fast”. no radar gun or anything else, so fuck him."
1913,"“previously, sheriff chronister said, deputies had tried to speak to howard-browne on at least two separate occasions about the ‘dangerous environment’ the church was creating. he said hcso command staff went to the east tampa church, but they were advised by church leaders and legal staff that howard-browne was refusing to see them and also refusing to cancel the sunday church services.”"

1920,wrestlers are tough bastards and knowing how to grapple even just a little bit gives a person a big leg up on someone who knows nothing at all. good on him.

1922,"poul anderson was great. not too crazy about this covers, though."
1923,this is definitely worse than indian joker. i’ve got cancer now.
1924,sounds like you live in my old neighborhood.
1925,"i made the enormous mistake of buying a house in a cul-de-sac that unbeknownst to me was the neighborhood party zone. all of the guys who owned houses there had known each other since high school and there massive parties every weekend all weekend. it was nothing but gigantic white pickup trucks, loud country music, shouting, and discarded beer cans all the time. their friends walked through our yard and everyone parked their vehicles in the center of the circle so getting in and out of our home was a nightmare. i had scoped out the area prior to purchasing the home, but the bubba i bought it from apparently had his buddies keep things quiet until the paperwork was signed, then everything went back to business as usual. i couldn’t do dick about any of it, either. it was a small town and the cops were friends with all of these guys. i eventually sold the house at a significant financial loss because no one else wanted to move in and i couldn’t take it anymore. honestly, it was like being back in high school again or maybe being stranded at someone’s deer camp 24/7. i’m still afraid to buy a house again because of this. i was never so unhappy."
1926,"the one in the shitty little mississippi town i used to live in used failure to signal when changing lanes. they got me with that one several times driving down the same stretch of road. i knew where they were waiting and what they were doing, too, and always signaled or whatever yet it was always the same excuse to question me about where i was going while shining their flashlights all over my car."
1927,be sure to share to r/velvethippos for maximum dog shaming!
1928,"i grew up in the eighties. grandma is right. this would’ve been a nightmare, even for a kid like me who was used to entertaining himself with books and art supplies. that said, it doesn’t mean anyone else’s boredom is invalid or less sincere. it’s not like i want other people to feel uncomfortable. there’s only so much playing on social media and gaming one can do."
1929,"i’m in tucson, az and all of our bizarre mini dinosaurs are coming out of their burrows this week. i may be stuck at home, but watching honey i shrunk jurassic park is going to be fun."

1950,"are you on instagram? this rocks! i love the symmetry and decorative quality of the art. the bold outlines and flowing curves of the resin almost make me think of art nouveau. the shading is so carefully applied, and the stippling adds texture that contrasts nicely with the rest of the smooth draftsmanship. i particularly like how you chose not to go for a perfect one-to-one depiction of the queen and instead capture its essence. you're a great artist!"

2004,"honestly, i question almost everything i read these days if it has anything to do with any topic related to corporations of any type. 

we know beyond question that they have been playing dirty for a long time, subjecting the rest of us to the deliberate degradation of the environment in the name of increasing profits and unchecked growth. 

i assume that there are corporate plants everywhere, if not participating in the dialogue, then collecting data from it without authorization so they can use it for whatever their fucked up agenda is.  

are there any actual human beings that high up?  or just a bunch of lizard-brained freakshows?"

2034,"i cried at work yesterday for the first time.  i work in a grocery store, and was asked to help a shopper.  i was on the floor for quite a while (over an hour) and they allowed too many people in.  i don't know what the actual peak number was, but the store was very busy.  like, busier than a regular saturday might be.  i could feel the panic welling up as i helped the person with their shop, and while i made pleasant chit-chat with the people closest to me in the line (40 mins of the hour +).  as soon as i was finished with the task, i made a beeline for the staff bathroom before i had a public meltdown.  for the first time, i felt personally unsafe, as opposed to just at risk.  if it hadn't been for an angel of a colleague who stayed with me and helped me calm down, i might still be in there all blotchy, soggy and hyperventilating.  

i totally understand where you're coming from and the need to vent this existential fear and sorrow.  and then the need to shut it down again so that you can function.  sharing our weakness with each other helps to build us up and be stronger because we're less alone.  much love to  you and yours."

2106,"there’s a segment of 80s music that felt nostalgic when it was created — that’s what the katrina and the waves version sounds like to me. the pull of kimberly’s vocals and the guitar.

the bangles version pulls you in with the steady, slightly adrift rhythm and the vocal arrangement. this feels like an 80s song with 60s roots. (in a playlist, love plus one could come next and so could daydream believer.)

my parents died 3 years ago. i handled the estate work, but i didn’t speak at their gravesides (i’m a chicken crybaby and thankfully have a brother who loves to talk). if i ever do end up speaking at a funeral, however, i will ask the funeral home folks for help (ie, ask them to listen to my words and ask for presentation pointers). that’s just based on my experience. they’re professionals, good at what they do, and really do thrive off helping people.

2119,"ah, it was a really great comment in that it was so poignant (and yet modern, if that makes sense). after i read it, i tried to imagine the different types of memories of my old pal (orange wire-haired terrier; 2004-2017) that would disappear as different regions of my brain shut down. 


the first were those that involved movement — his fur blowing as he stood halfway out the car window. or, the way his ears bobbed when he walked in front of me. the second — still pictures of his face. then, tactile memories — eg, how his fur felt when i reached out to pet him when we sat side by side. last to go, i think, would be the sound and rhythm of his walk. i say that because i still hear the clip clop of his nails in their distinctive pattern as he follows me down the basement stairs.

2120,"it’s that damn pet part. i want to downvote based on pure emotional response, but the comment actually deserves an upvote. so i’m stalled.


also, something like this would make a great video short. a depiction of neurons and pathways shutting down, and a narrative of what they are saying goodbye to (not a scientific depiction per se, but a progressive erasure of the people, creatures, ideas, abilities, etc. that we’ve spent our lives cultivating)."

2127,"i worry about worrying and worry about what all this worrying is doing to me. i never understood the concept of worrying until i was in my early 40s. literally, i physiologically and psychologically had no experience with “worry.” and then, i started worrying about money, about sick parents, and then dying parents. after that, i started worrying about my own demise, my biology, genetics, telomeres, nutrition, cancer, decay, alzheimer’s, parkinson’s, and on and on and on.


it’s a stupid way to live. for the past 2 years, i’ve been headed back to the path of “not worrying.” which has required a lot a focus on creating and building, vs maintaining and preventing."
2128,"the eye poke was kind of asshole-ish, but  he is showing such restraint. gentle jerk?"
2129,"i’m not vegan, but i do somehow end up making a lot of vegan dishes. 


- baked/roasted sweet potatoes with cinnamon. usually, i dice some sweet potatoes and steam them for a bit. then, i’ll coat them lightly with some oil (either avocado or extra virgin olive oil; avocado imparts the least flavor and has a higher smoke point, but imo, either works). sprinkle/coat with cinnamon and bake or roast in the oven. (i don’t have time/temp guidance; for me, these are pretty hard to screw up). add salt to taste if desired.


- tofu scramble — i would just google, there are a ton of recipes out there. if you belong to a costco, they sell a 4-pack of organic tofu for @ $5. you could experiment with a couple of recipes before the actual brunch — it won’t be wasted effort, because the recipes often translate well to egg dishes (i never would have thought to sprinkle curry powder on my eggs if it weren’t for tofu scramble).


- avocado toast, like someone mentioned above. or maybe homemade guacamole with toast squares.


- a box of vegan granola and/or a box of vegan unsweetened muesli on standby, with some unsweetened almond milk. (people can always add sugar, but they can’t take it away.)


-  desert — vegan sweet potato pie or vegan bean pie. you will have to make enough for everyone, though, because they are both delicious and addictive! sorry, no particular recipes to recommend. my neighborhood co-op sells both, and i used to buy one once a week, until i acknowledged that my ass would keep expanding if i kept doing so.


- r/plantbaseddiet may have some good ideas if you search for breakfast or brunch.


- look for the “vegan” label on anything you buy pre-packaged (eg, my favorite muesli, which i always assumed was vegan, states that it “may contain traces of milk.”)


- i love cooking breakfast, and i love butter. for me, the hardest thing to remember re: vegan breakfast is not to use butter."

2305,"most drugs are now or were originally made from chemical precursors found in botanical extracts like essential oils, like almost all opiates for example."
2306,you’ve been misled.  volatile oils are fragrant but an essential oil does not necessarily have to be defined as having a fragrance.  cooking oils are also essential oils of things like sunflower seeds or safflower or canola seeds.
2307,this is wrong.  an non-polar botanical extract is an essential oil by 18th century definitions of the term.  cooking oil is the essential oil of safflower.  nothing about the definition of the term necessarily means it must be a fragrant oil.
2308,"no one ever ate tree bark for this purpose.  they did however eat the essential oil of the willow tree (actually it was an aqueous extract, aka “tea”)"

i can’t wait until you find out the original meaning of the word “organic”."
2310,">let me ask you this: how many plant oils are generally considered to be ‘essential oils’ and how many have good evidence for their usage, versus how many oils that don’t?

i'm a lipid biochemist by training.  perhaps i'm not the best person to answer this question.  what i perceive as ""generally considered an essential oil"" and ""good evidence for their usage"" i expect are radically different than most.  i already gave my sesame oil example.  i could provide examples like that for almost every essential oil on the market.  i view essential oils as vitally important sources of botanical chemicals.  ""aromatherapy"" and massage oils are the furthest from my thinking when the word ""essential oil"" is invoked in the circles i travel in.  i suspect i have similarly different definitions for words like ""organic"" (carbon based), ""natural product"", (literally a chemical derived from a once living thing), and ""aromatic"" (a conjugated system of free moving electrons).

but this is why i have such objections to a scientific paper using the colloquial definition of the term ""essential oil"" without qualification.  this is also why i expect the authors have zero training in medicinal chemistry.  i think they would know better otherwise."
2311,"yes i do, as it depends on the eo in question.  i think the authors do not understand medicinal chemistry very well or else they would know that the large majority of modern drug molecules started off as biological extracts.


again, the oil of the poppy has about 30% morphine, and i don’t think i need to provide a citation to assert that it’s biological mechanisms through which benefit is provided are extremely well understood.  

perhaps a more esoteric example is better.  the active component of sesame oil (sesamin, for inflammation) is a wildly potent inhibitor of delta-5 desaturase, which is required for synthesis of arachidonic acid, which in turn is the precursor to all the pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes.  

http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=desaturase+inhibitors+sesamin+inflammation&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart

i mean i get it, aromatherapy and other related bullshit has given essential oils a bad name, but it is a fact that these products comprised most of humanity’s first pharmaceuticals and there are very good reasons for that.  but for these authors to ignore that fact and cast all essential oils as something new with no basis in anything but modern new agey woo woo ignores the origins of these extracts and their demonstrable utility for human health."
2312,"“but the oils are also marketed as natural remedies for a variety of conditions, including anxiety, autism, depression, stress, pain, insomnia, high blood pressure, bacterial infections, skin conditions, and even spiritual and relationship problems.”

in this statement alone they conflate a number of well-supported indications with quackery.

anxiety - no

autism - no

depression - yes

stress - no

pain - yes

insomnia - yes

high blood pressure - yes

infections and skin conditions - yes

spiritual - no


i mean pain is the most obvious one.  the essential oil of poppies has been used for millennia for systemic pain relief.  the essential oil of cinnamon works well for local or topical pain.  the biochemistry is recognized and well understood.  just because we have better and safer ways of treating pain with prescription meds does not mean the old ways are completely invalid."
2313,"they are, by implication, suggesting that no essential oil has evidence-supported value.  that is an incorrect thing to imply."
2314,"i agree.  i’ve told them they need to figure out the situation with their va loan, or they may need to give up on this house they’ve lined up in vt.

still though, that doesn’t feel like the best solution."
2316,any oil extract from a plant is an essential oil.  high-cbd cannabis oils or butters are essential oils.
2317,"cripes.  i would have liked this study better if they made the correlation to crystal healing instead.  i mean, essential oils are just a botanical extract and so many of our current drugs today still come from botanical extracts and essential oils.  aspirin comes from willow tree bark, the essential oil of sassafras is the precursor to mdma, and i think we’re all aware of the essential oil of cannabis.  the preferred front-line antimalarial drug is from the essential oil of sweet wormwood.

i mean ya, if someone thinks sniffing lavender oil will cure cancer, they are ignorant or gullible, but to broadly malign all essential oils as quackery makes the maligners look just as ignorant."
2318,"mutations which make it easy to identify and avoid sock people will be selected against.  coughing, runny nose, etc. is both a positive and negative selection, because it can also help spread the virus.  induction of fever is only a negative selector.

2331,"the way you phrased made it sound like they take both a positive test with symptoms or just symptoms alone as inclusion criteria.

2332,"all virus infections follow this curve.  epidemiology 101 dictates a sigmoid curve.  what you describe, if anything would create a bigger acceleration, not the slowing hump."
2333,"the steps of the scientific method are as follows:

1) make an observation.
2) ask a question.
3) form a hypothesis, or testable explanation.
4) make a prediction based on the hypothesis.
5) test the prediction.
6) iterate: use the results to make new hypotheses or predictions.

steps 3 and 4 (and sometimes 2 and 5) require one to imagine fictions.  you must imagine objects or forms or dynamics which are not currently known to exist, and then render them in some way (step 5).  this is the very core of the artistic process as well.  it is why most universities combine their departments of ""art and sciences"" at the highest levels."

i’m proud to say all of my most important published studies have been reproduced by independent groups.  however, this would not have been so if i had not been communicating with these groups when problems arise.  sometimes my papers had typos.  sometimes i did not write a method clearly enough.  

from my own anecdotal experience these kinds of publication errors, coupled with a lack of communication with the corresponding author, are what lead to the large majority of irreproducibility.  fabricated data are very rare.

that said, i also always reproduce my own experiments several times as a self-imposed pre-requisite of publication.  if one repetition of five fails to reproduce, i’ve usually tracked the problem down to something mundane, like an improperly prepared reagent or an accidentally transposed column on an excel sheet."

2370,"ya, acetate was just shorthand for acetyl-coa.  and yes, the full tca is not involved  or required, just parts of it.  i deleted my comment above because i had wrongly implied humans had a glyoxylate cycle which they do not."
2372,"oh?  i thought the article also spoke to gluconeogenesis from acetate generally - both fat and aa?  well it’s in the refs from the wiki too.

“other glucogenic amino acids as well as all citric acid cycle intermediates, the latter through conversion to oxaloacetate, can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis.[8]”

beta oxidation burns fats down to acetyl-coa (and ketones) which drops into tca and eventually supplies some of the oxaloacetate.  it’s only like 10% of the gluconeogenic precursors, but it does contribute nonetheless."
2373,"i was 6 or 7.  i was playing in a patch of woods next to my house which bordered a busy street at the end of a long steep hill.  i looked up when i heard that click click click sound of a ten-speed bike coming down the hill fast, and saw some guy with his head turned all the way around, suddenly hit the sewer grate he didn’t see.

i ran up to him a few seconds after he hit the pavement.  his face under the eyes was completely bashed - just a mess of teeth and tongue and nose hair in all directions.  his eyes were as big as saucers looking at nothing, and he was breathing really ragged and gurgling.  his arms were straight to his sides, neck was at an impossible angle and his feet were twitching.

my first thought was that this guy might die at any moment, but also that i was the only one around and i had to help him somehow.  i leaned in to tell him not to worry and that i would be right back with my mom.  i waited for some kind of response for a second or two.  i didn’t get anything but more ragged gurgles, and started off running.  

mom called 911 and then kept me away while she went to our neighbor who was a nurse.  the paramedics showed up quickly, and jumped into action for about a minute. but then they took their time loading him in the ambulance.  to this day my mom won’t admit that i was the last person to see that guy alive."
2376,"fats *can* be turned into glucose and other sugars by eukaryotes, by precisely the biochemical path that you imagine.  why do you think they can’t?

as an example, plenty of yeasts can proliferate using fat as a sole carbon source.  if they could not convert that fat to glucose they could not make most of their structural polysaccharides, most notably their cell walls.  this causes death.  yeast (and all other fungi) make their cell walls from chitin, which is a polysaccharide comprised of acetylglucosamine, which is made from glucose.  the yarrowia genus is famous for its ability to use fat as a sole carbon source.

similarly, human beings, when on a strict ketogenic diet, can convert fat to glucose, again usually to supply structural polysaccharides to various tissues."
2377,"most of my work travel is to ancient cities in the eu and the higher col cities of the us.  the best part for me are the hotel gyms and the brief periods of time off on evenings and weekends to wander around and see the sights.  i also like that i can eat a fresh salad any time i want.

the second worst part is that no hotel ever has a pillow i actually enjoy.  i sleep on my stomach and no pillow they offer is ever flat enough for me, so i usually just sleep without one.  

the absolute worst part is that my family is not with me and i’m not with them.  homesickness usually sets in on day 4."

do not take this as me defending the actions of trump in any way.  

if you look at the two impeachments by just the letter of the law, clinton obstructed justice too, and was impeached for it.  he obstructed justice with attempts to influence witnesses (just like trump) - mainly monica lewinsky.  however unlike trump, he ultimately complied with every subpeona.  

the most important distinction between trump and clinton impeachments is that both of clinton's impeachment articles related 100% to congress' investigation, rather than to any crimes committed prior to the investigation.  trump's abuse of power impeachment ""quid pro quo"" is vastly more harmful to the republic, and everyone knows it."

2487,"okay, this made me smile. thank you."
2488,why so little?? disability should be much more after working that long and a job that is higher paying.
2489,i love you so hard. thank you for this!
2490,i'm so sorry for your loss. :(

2498,"a few years ago, i invited a health care attorney to speak to my graduate students.

she said, ""it's absolutely unconstitutional for a licensing board to say who you can be friends with and who you cannot. we just need to wait for someone to challenge this legally.""

now i'm not eager to become friends with most of my clients but i think she's right. i'm just not going to be the one who legally challenges this with a board. what an expensive nightmare that would be."
2499,what kind of oil? coconut?
2500,"i mean it is a legit name... if you live in 900 ad...

2502,aww. sweet babe. i have three cats who are always fighting over the tallest perch of the cat tree. i didn't realize one could be afraid of heights.
2503,must be pretty standard. i don't recall a vet taking any of my cat's temperatures on visits except the one time i brought my late senior cat in for an actual illness. i never really realized until reading that sign.
2504,so wobbly!
2505,what?! sorcery!
2506,"ugh, those key holders are over all the time. now that i locked them out of using the computer constantly, they just drink water after water and leave the half empty glasses on every surface. i actually wouldn't mind them taking mud baths instead of all those glasses. 🙄"

2508,girl in red's date didn't coordinate with her dress so well. i wonder if it's a last minute date switch after a breakup?

2510,"maybe he's picking up his meds. maybe he's delivering groceries to his elderly mother. maybe he's going to work in an essential role to keep us fed and warm while we're home. he's obviously urging people to take this seriously in the vid, so he's probably not out just fucking around."
2511,many someones have died.
2512,"all our delivery drivers knock, drop, and run. they've been doing it far longer than the virus has been around, so i guess business as usual?"
2513,ahhh. i know right? i love vintage cookware so much. patterns like this need a comeback; they're so cute!
2514,"i've never put them on top of my head? i mean the look is cute, but i am legally blind without them, so they are always on."
2515,"i'm not in healthcare but just wanted to say that my nurse practitioner and her medical assistant are both plus size women. she is the best provider i've ever been to. i'm approaching this as another fat woman, but their size isn't even an issue that i'd ever think about. competence and rapport can exist at any size. 

congrats on the new job. you got this!"
2516,they recently brought duke's up to northern ohio. after so long of hearing my friends from the south sing it's praises i now have a jar in my fridge. i am converted!
2517,"well, *hello there* sailor."
2518,that's what i've been doing during quarantine. i ordered a weekly meal kit box to avoid the stores as much as possible. it's been getting me out of my comfort zone of convenience food. although it can be a bit dangerous. i cut my finger last night slicing tomatoes for pico de gallo. 😣

2522,witsec should have sent her to a crappy postage stamp studio two cities over to blend into the crowd. they're giving her a nice vacation and all she does is whine about it. 😑

2524,"well *hello there*, mortimer"
2525,rice and beans are all sold out here too. as well as all the meat. the only department fully stocked is produce. i've been having some great fresh veggie meals lately.

2528,i made that tonight too! was pretty darn good.
2529,such a cuddlebug!
2530,"omg, i love them at the toddling stage with those little antenna-tails. little heart thief!"
2531,"not a fan of menards either. they fully stock their greenhouse/garden center with beautiful flowers and then let them all wilt and die because they seem to be too cheap to hire anyone to care for them. in contrast, walmart of all places always has someone out watering and taking excellent care of their stock. go figure.

(poor dead petunias. i wish someone got to you in time.)"
2532,"yes, so do this! my mom saved papers from her wedding day, jfk assassination, and the moon walk for her future kids. i came along in '74 and they are seriously the coolest things i own now. perfectly preserved history."

2535,"i certainly know it. i love vintage shoe styles, but i wear an 11. i have to stick to modern replicas and just admire the teeny-tiny real ones like cinderella's stepsisters. :("
2536,awww. domino's. 😁
2537,some cute vintage shoes there. i wonder how many are still chilling in the back of some granny's closet?
2538,i haven't heard anything to the contrary yet. her tentative release date was set for the 18th before the lockdown. i have assumed she'd be safer at home with just one person than there with dozens of staff and hundreds of residents.
2539,aww. mama is proud of her little babe. she looks so gentle.
2540,"same. i'm 46 and my mom is going to turn 82 next week. she's stuck in a rehab facility after an illness and is basically quarantined there. no visitors. i'm isolating myself here to be as safe as possible when she gets released soon. 

it's just a mess with no way to personally monitor her care daily other than what she tells me by phone, which is of course, complaints. 😑"
2541,"when i went yesterday there was one single package of 12 rolls on the shelf.  i was tempted to just take it, but i remembered i have 22 rolls left at home and someone was probably completely out and needed it. 

it was hard to resist, though! i hope my karma comes back around when my own supply is depleted."
2542,wonder wedgie 84.
2543,"oh good. i'm in real need of bar soap and was worried it'd be gone. i haven't been to the store since monday and everything was fine then. even had some tp, though it was starting to look low."
2544,gentleman bodyguard #2 please and thanks. 🤤
2545,i just noticed my mostly all white kitty had a single black whisker a few days ago. i am now declaring it my favorite of her whiskers too. 😸
2546,i think i had this exact model back in jr high. that snazzy woodgrain... lol. and always waking up to a whitney houston song for some reason.
2547,i was going to ask how you found that perfectly printed fabric for her! it came out so gorgeous ❤️

2559,"now that's a disabled bathroom with some space for equipment! as a caregiver, i've seen so many poor excuses for accessibility (looking at you, cinemark movie theaters) that this makes me giggle with glee."
2560,"she looks fabulous for her age. still has a kitten face, even. sending her gentle pets and snuggles."
2561,"surprised no one mentioned that he specifically says he wants a daughter with op? i would think the usual talk about children is just that: i want to have kids with you, gender-neurtal. 

at the least i would be worried he wouldn't be accepting of any boys that might be born. at worst, i'd think he'd have bad intentions toward the girls. 

personally at 4 months in, that would be a 🚩 if he couldn't expand upon that specific stated preference to my satisfaction."
2562,she looks soooo soft.
2563,vewy scawy!

2569,"my closest walmart has an overflow of disabled people parking this way, especially in front of the door closest to the pharmacy. there are just not enough handicapped spots for everyone who needs one. those parallel spots seem far too long even if someone is using a ramp and could be adjusted to squeeze in a few more slots so people can pick up their prescriptions without having to illegally park. :-(

this is only going to become a bigger issue as the boomers get older every year. source: driver of disabled elderly mom who can rarely find a space anywhere these days"
2570,it says down syndrome is a risk factor for developing sleep apnea. so... the opposite of what you read?

2578,"yuuup. my cycle has been pretty good lately but maybe once a year i'll get what i refer to as a skipped period, but it's more like you describe. all the discomfort, discharge, but no actual blood. the next one usually shows up on schedule and acts normally. 

i thought it was a symptom of peri-menopause (since i'm 46), but it's probably just good ol pcos again."
2579,mine it's always paolo rocca. always.

2592,"oh nice rando townie. since he's a bartender i'd scruff him up a bit, give him a beard or some stubble and maybe a tat sleeve. but then i only build dive bars and pubs. lol"
2593,"i keep all the childhood stages as is and lengthen the adult/elder stages a bit in mccc. i want grandparents in game and normal length lifespans usually mean they're dead by the time their kids have kids (unless they all start a family super early). with uni now, i extend ya a bit more still so they don't spend all that stage at school."
2594,"is that an aldi scratcher cabin i spy in the back there?  i wanted one of those but never saw it in my store.

my chonk didn't get one for christmas."
2595,"yep. they had a great relationship started, but i made her break up with him before she started going to uni. no second date. i was afraid of what might happen next time. lol"
2596,"lol. i was marked absent by a teacher who apparently didn't see me right there in my assigned seat. mom was called. panic about me being missing happened. i had no idea the entire time.

invisibility is my superpower, i think."
2597,"i've seen those rolling conversations, yes. two of my coworkers used to get into those, and it was kind of mind boggling to listen to. i am definitely on the extreme introverted side of the spectrum, and i don't think i have ever been in one of those unknowingly. i do get along much better with my mom. probably because she was the only one interested enough to talk to me about a kid's life.

as far as i remember this incident was just a usual dinner time ""tell us about your day"" catch up session for everyone to share. i happily listened to so, so much about old cars and fishing over the years during these. i know more than most who have never been into either of those hobbies. lol"
2598,"> let's be honest here....you didn't pay attention to what he was saying either.  so it's a two way street. 

because i didn't specify exactly what topic he interrupted us with? this was over 30 years ago. i don't remember exactly what topic i was speaking about either. a guess would be school since that is basically a 13 year olds life. which he interrupted to tell me was stupid. and also implied that my mother was also stupid to be talking to me about it. 

in fact he treated my mother a great deal like you describe treating your wife. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
2599,😧
2600, man. we are so fucked.
2601,i like it a lot!
2602,the guy behind the girl in red is a floating head.

2604,lmao
2605,isn’t that crazy?
2606,i have a millennial kid and she drives me crazy. we fight constantly. i can never make her happy and she just mopes around and fights with people on the internet including my family. it’s insane. i’m not saying all millennials are wrong or bad just like any other generations but some are flat out crazy.

2669,"i had a stalker about 5 years ago and i was home alone watching tv one day and heard someone knocking on the door to my apartment. i stupidly opened the door thinking it was fedex with my phone. nope. it was my stalker. he rammed his way into my house knocking pictures off the walls because he was so high he couldn’t even function. i don’t know how he walked up the 22 stairs to my apartment. he laid on my couch and i was freaking out. i took out my phone and started to dial 911. i told him i was calling the cops. he very fortunately ended up leaving. i was so freaked. a few days later he was arrested and sent to prison for badly beating up a girl and stealing stuff from her house. he got out a year later and was in a half way house in chicago where he ended up dead of a drug overdose. i swear i can’t make this shit up. i felt bad about being relieved he was dead, but i sleep better at night also."

2713,"in the book it’s said that belinda and her friends were kind of like dopey valley girl chicks who met pat smear and darby crash because they were all trying to stalk freddie mercury at the same hotel.

belinda was supposed to be the first drummer for the germs but she got mono and they found someone else.



joan produced a germs album and they were mad because she was drunk all the time and actually passed out on the mixing board. but they also talk about how her place was a punk haven. they don’t get into particulars of her relationships.

you should read the book it’s really good."

2716,"if you ever want a good read check out lexicon devil, the oral history of everyone involved with the germs in the 70s. joan is in there and it’s alleged that she did some awful things to punks who hit on her girlfriends"
2717,"when i bought that album as a kid i skipped the first 5 tracks to get to “enjoy” and it was only by accident one day that i played the album from the beginning..:that was when i realized dm was actually not just a bad 1-single band like information society or something. i was blown away by the first side of that album....err, the first 4 tracks"
2718,that’s undeniably their best album. it shouldn’t even be a question.
2719,how were they selling out? was it because they changed labels? this was a commercial band from the beginning. violator was way more subversive than anything they did in the early 80s. it just doesn’t make sense.
2721,"songs of faith and devotion was...well, there is something wrong with that album and i’m not sure what it is. i have been ambivalent about that one forever. might need to relisten. 


one thing is for sure, everything after alan wilder left is awful."

2780,"also your truck has rpo codes in the glove box which will tell u thing like if u have a trans cooler for tow, rear axle gear ect. comes in very helpful just search gm rpo codes and find what's yours."
2781,payload and max towing are your start points for your truck but this doesnt mean it can handle the max. last year i had a 2011 5.3 silverado 1500 as well with tow package. i had the 3.42 rear axle transcooler ect. max tow 10500. we pull a tt with gvwr of 4800. level pulled it just fine. we travel from phoenix up north on 6 degree inclines and it was not an enjoyable experience for me. alot of white knuckle driving and high trans temps. to solve or attempt to i added some hp and a larger trans cooler and to no avail helped very little. i was at the point of taking rear to 3.90 or 4.10 and then said f it and bought a ram 2500 diesel. all travels are amazing now. i know people cant just buy new rides but my point being even though i had 10500 max tow even half that wasnt enjoyable so at minimum see if you can test pull and find some decent incline. the again if your in flat land with no incline then still try a test pull first. good luck.
2782,lol totally forgot about this gem

2805,ram 2500 diesel and your done if u ever upgrade your good to go.
2806,"i'll post same answer i did when u asked the question once before and before 
yes it has a overfill protects due to this....

overfilling the gas tank can cause liquid gas to enter the charcoal canister, or carbon filter, which is designed only for vapor. gas in the system can affect your car's performance by causing it to run poorly, and damage the engine"
2807,op please post again 5 times isnt enough
2808,yes for gods sake we all know now how bats pee now
2809,the circle?
2810,same here. no issues
2811,fuel filter ?
2812,run lola run
2813,also the resale just plummeted severely
2814,i just dont understand why and just thinking of taking the shot at cutting a hole in the side of the slide had to be a lot of anxiety.
2815,"yes too much. 
this engine has a towing capacity ranging from 8,550 pounds (3.21 axle ratio) to 10,700 pounds (3.92 axle ratio).

even if the trailer was between 8500 and 10700 still be too much imo.  get a diesel."
2816,"should have a sticker somewhere that has all the weight info you need. usually on side or behind storage door on outside. i added larger trans cooler,  increased hp with borla catback exhaust , s&b cold air intake,  air ride to level rear end,  weight distrubution and equalizer hitch. alot for nothing imo we tow alot so for us the answer was upgrade and be happy, we are but for only one trip? as long you know mechanically your truck will make it just get the hitch set up and save your cash."
2817,alot of info needed mainly weight of that rig.  quick google shows your tow capacity is 10k but as i learned with a chevy 1500 with tow package and larger trans cooler that had same tow max it was miserable for me. level towed a 5k trailer somewhat on but every 6 degree hill sucked. 230 to 245 trans temp and just dog slow and wasnt fun to go on trips. i added anything and everything i could to avoid new truck and in the end went 2500 cummins.
2818,make one or have one made.
2819,there is 1 way.  you would have to hit a pause button for 30days on everything. no gain no loss no bill's just pause and after 30 days restart as if nothing happened. but everyone would have to be involved.

2831,"same here. all for saving animals but it states ""similar to dental implants"" with insurance your still 3k for a dental implant.  pretty sure cat insurance wont cover this but if they did that's like 12k. not how many people would drop 12k on a cat (no offense cat people really i mean no harm)"
2832,very true and 100% agree!
2833,i agree that this movie was best lector film but best lector imo was not hopkins but actually mads mikkelsen in the fox series.
2834,"why havent you is the real question, get going, move along, you got your whole life ahead. be smart, be careful, and be excited!"
2835,"i would guess there is something that prevent over filling and that why it did that but the reason is as follows... 

overfilling the gas tank can cause liquid gas to enter the charcoal canister, or carbon filter, which is designed only for vapor. gas in the system can affect your car's performance by causing it to run poorly, and damage the engine"

2842,(2)6v  batteries correct? not 1
2843,"most likely low batteries. again new batteries is irrelevant. if your 2 days in and most likely running heater, lights and whatever else good chance low battery.  do you have 1 or 2 12v batteries. what have you been using them for. if you have a generator plug in and charge up."
2844,"for the inverter itself 4 things it may be. 
1. its beeping to inform it is on battery power
2. it's in low battery condition
3. it's at capacity overload
4. it failed a self test.

you should pull your manual to diagnose. we would need more info like what brand. you state batteries are new but that doesnt mean charged. are you plugged into shore power or just on 12v battery."
2845,is it the inverter or the co2 / lp / battery meter usually mounted near the inverter.
2846,prometheus was 2012 they said after 2015. covenant was a decent space movie but i agree not as good by far from interstellar and the martian but imo better than ad astra i hated that movie.
2847,i took it as manon being upset they are abusing power and that look was manons disappointment in her
2848,u9 near the batteries usual under nest the frame looks like a red pacifier usually. but that being said this is to shut batteries off from being drained while storing. all my 12 v works when plugged into sgore with b9 batteries on board. your inverter should do this check fuses in there.
2849,alien covenant?  2017

2862,previous van lifer here and never a time i thought i should do radiant floors. we used heater buddys to keep us warm but the insulation was the major thing to do. we filled all the metal openings with moving blankets or insulation the reflectix the wood walls and floor did a reflectix then plywood the a vinyl flooring.

2868,camo steering wheel cover?
2869,this isnt hard just time consuming and patience involved. there are plenty of videos showing how to. i agree with above poster that shops dont like doing it but because of that it's something i would do myself. if your mechanically inclined and that type of guy (or gal) that has the patience and is particular of doing things the right way i would do it yourself. i know i do a helluva better job because its mine vs some kid getting shitty pay who really doesnt care what your ride is like.  just my 2c.

2922,"i keep thinking the mass-produced food that we ate growing up in the 70s and 80s is contributing to it too, especially with heart attacks and things like that. the boomers had home cooked meals and the millenials+ have grass fed and organic foods, but we had sugary cereals, chips, sodas and whatever else they marketed our way."

2949,"great article. and yes to this part especially:

perhaps most important, gen x is playing a critical and overlooked role in bridging the digital divide. while millennials are often thought of as the most digitally savvy, gen x leaders were just as confident in their digital leadership capability. meanwhile, gen x also excels in traditional leadership skills that are more critical than ever, showing empathy and driving for execution similar to how their baby boomer counterparts do."

2983,"just to reinforce that point: you decide how something should look and how it should taste. make several problem items to share with the crew—this is what it should taste like, this is how it should be plated.  it’s time well spent for them to all be on the same page and sample as a team."
2984,"five senators have been outed. one is a democrat, four are not. i am not at liberty to reveal their political party, but if you follow the vague clues left by qanon, you will unearth the dark conspiracy."

3003,"for starters, the entire medical insurance industry (which is nothing more than administrators and sales people) could be transferred to the research and development of treatments and equipment for the care industry. rather than working to make money on illness, work to make money on prevention and treatment. if you have health insurance, you pay for it weather you use it or not. if you get sick, you still have more to pay. once you have spent all the money you have to pony up, then they might pay for your treatment, as long as they don’t have a reason to deny it. how is the continually rising price of insurance, therefore healthcare, sustainable?"
3004,"only a percentage of people infected will show symptoms or get sick, so people can walk around like little virus factories feeling just fine and they have been doing so for weeks. examples such as rand paul and boris johnson come to mind. the infections we are seeing are just the teeny, weeny tip of the testing iceberg. just because you can’t see it, doesn’t mean it isn’t there."
3005,the world will be slightly different with the culling of individuals. a lot like a filter on insta.
3006,"fair enough. sorry for that interpretation. but considering your circumstances, today you is less well off financially, and that doesn’t affect your optimism or sense of security? i’m not saying people would be having deep fundamental shifts, but i was really satisfied with how it looked like life was going and now i’m frightened for my family business and my family health like i never saw coming a month and a half ago."

3054,"just like you described. tomatoes and onions from these guys, herbs and lettuce from this farm, mushrooms from ...we picked up our own produce for years. talk to your local farmers market, you may be able to buy their leftovers wholesale. it’s not consistent, but it could be a convenient one-stop shop partnership that co-brands your restaurant with the growers. 
our restaurant has partnered with farms small enough to supply only us—we choose what they grow. but it is a patchwork."

3233,"does he ever actually play that banjo, or does he just dick around with the sequencer the whole video?"
3234,"i see his suit has gotten a bit less... form-fitting. good. that always unnerved me as a small child. 

seriously, though, good on him for keeping it going."
3235,">culture and food are not that important. we understand that real food and hospitality will no longer exist.

yeah, everybody knows that the food scenes in seattle and portland suck. /s

if you want something like bartlett, i suggest vancouver, wa, or, like, clackamas."
3236,"i was thinking the other day about a hypothetical person who was born in 1900. 

that person would have come of age just in time for ww1; then would have immediately endured the 1918 flu; then after a few years been ungulfed in the great depression; and then launched straight into ww2. by the time things finally settled into some semblance of sustained peace and prosperity, they'd have been in their 50s. 

sometimes it feels like life since 2000 has just been an endless ordeal, but maybe that's actually normal."
3237,that wasn't very magnanimous.
3238,"our academic library is open, reduced hours, and only for college-affiliated people. oh, and also anybody asking to use the government documents. but they'd have to know to ask."
3241,"the older i get, the more resonant this song feels. i wonder if david byrne feels the same way.

seriously, though, there are days when i feel like the world is demanding that i remove water from the bottom of the ocean."
3242,"i mean, for me, it's basically just black skinny jeans, black ankle boots, either a nice/fancy-ish black tee or a black cami, and then either a very light, long black cardigan (the way it fits on my shoulders always reminds me of kurt cobain circa unplugged) if i'm aiming more grunge, or a black sweater blazer if i'm aiming more gallery owner. distressed jeans would probably make it more grunge, but my workplace, while casual, isn't quite *that* casual. from there's just down to jewelry choices. 

i might be overselling it -- you could probably label a look like that any number of ways -- but having lived through the grunge era for real (ah, my youth), i'm standing by my label. ;)"
3243,"i really want to resist this stereotype, but there's no denying the number of cardigans in my wardrobe.

having said that, most of the time i try to switch it up with ""grunge goth gallery owner"" and ""north woods lumberjill."" and i have never rocked the peter pan collar -- i have a very round face, and i would fear people coming up to pinch my cheeks like the chubby little dumplin' i am."
3244,"i think i understand the point you're reaching for (you or your fellow students, whose position you're referencing), but censorship has a definition: ""the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security."" 

if anything, this is the *opposite* of that. this is *promotion* of the literature in question, this is highlighting it and presenting it to the community. you don't suppress literature by reading it aloud publicly.

i think you could make an argument that this event might be counterproductive in the long run, or might be ""shaming"" to readers who like these books unironically. i personally would disagree with that position, but i think you could make the case. but to call it censorship is cringey. words have meanings, and this is ridiculously outside the definition of the word being used here. 

also, as an aside, i read the title ""bad romance"" as an obsolete reference to the lady gaga song (very on-brand for librarians) rather than a value judgment. i could easily be wrong, but that's how i read it. 

also, romance novels are hilarious. small-town sheriff time-traveling vampire highlanders ftw."
3245,"we just had a meeting at my library to talk about what we were each doing to promote diversity, etc. in our library, and the single poc librarian did *not* want to be there. i can't blame her a bit for that. her whole life here is ""promoting diversity"" whether she wants to be doing it at any given moment or not. (this is a particularly white part of the northeast, so her life here is... yeah.)

it's hard to square this -- it's a worthy goal, it's part of our official goals (so it's necessary to document it), and we need to be thinking in these terms to make our library/campus more welcoming to poc students. but it feels awkward as hell to sit in a room full of white people (and one silent poc) talking about all the ""great"" things we're doing that don't really change anything."
3246,"okay, well, that's under the library science umbrella too, now that you mention it. mostly those people are called archivists, but they still generally get an mls or mlis, which is the same degree that librarians get. they may do some specialist training/education as well.

my best recommendation for a high school student thinking about heading down this road: see if you can volunteer for your local public library, or another library in your area. there are potentially a lot of things you could do, and it will give you a chance to start seeing what libraries are really like, and if you actually enjoy the work. or if you're heading off to college, see if you can get a student job at the college/university library. if you tell them you're interested in librarianship as a career, that will almost certainly get your foot in the door. it won't be glamorous, but you'll get to see what the work is really like. 

good luck to you!"
3247,"i mean... do you want to be a librarian? because a career in library science basically equals being a librarian. there are lots of ways to be a librarian, and most librarians can say lots of great things about the work they do. but yeah, it's pretty much librarians all the way down.  

i suppose you could also be a professor of library/information science, but becoming a professor of anything is not recommended. it's a very long, expensive road with an incredibly low chance of paying off. even becoming a professional librarian will almost always require a master's degree. bachelor's degrees  in lis are generally not recommended, unless you're really only thinking about lower-ranking positions in the library. even then, the ba isn't really strictly necessary for that kind of job.

the minor in psych sounds fine, though, if that sounds enjoyable to you. and if you're really thinking about information science (which is related to library science, but different), then that's a whole other conversation."
3248,"1) you don't have to decide what kind of librarian you want to be yet. i geared my course work to digital librarianship, then got my first job in a 9-12 boarding school, and now i'm an academic librarian at a small, private undergrad college. focus on the skills that interest you/your future employers need, and you'll find your place in time. 

2) librarianship is competitive, but not any more so than any other desirable professional career. archives is probably somewhat more competitive, if only because there are fewer positions, but i've known several people who successfully became archivists. 

3) the name of the school on your diploma has literally zero meaning. look for an ala-accredited program that fits your needs the best (including your financial needs) and covers the content that you're most interested in, and you're good to go. 

other random tips: your professional career starts on the first day of library school; be a good person to work with, and it'll serve you well after graduation. do as much practical, in-the-trenches library work as you possibly can while you're in school, because the opportunities are much easier to come by as a student, and practical experience trumps coursework every time. find a skill set that you can be especially good at -- technology, or instruction, or working with some marginalized group -- to ""value add"" to your mlis, so you stand out better against the crowd. good luck!"
3249,"i don't know why anyone would say that retail isn't relevant and not to include it...  librarians *love* customer service experience. librarianship is ultimately a service profession, after all, so customer service experience is absolutely relevant. 

i'd definitely include it, putting the emphasis on the service aspect. i included my few years in book retail in my resume when i was applying for my mls, and i'm an actual subject specialist/teaching academic librarian now. ;)"
3250,"nope, zowie bowie became duncan jones. he's a film director now. i mean, maybe he has a phd, but he was never a joey."
3251,"my first boyfriend called green day ""happy punk for happy people,"" with maximum derision intended. he was more helmet and skinny puppy than stone roses, but he gave me a my bloody valentine cd as his way of indicating romantic interest."
3254,"oh yes, they pay. they often pay substantially more than a consumer would for the same thing. we refer to it as institutional pricing. 

the publisher's rationale is, if ten people come to the library and look at a single copy of a magazine, that's ten subscriptions/purchases they've lost. which is... pretty silly, really, since the chances of all ten of those people paying for the magazine otherwise is remote. and really, the library probably got all those advertisements in front of nine more people than might've seen them otherwise. but what are you going to do? 

now i'm wondering whether doctor's offices have to pay institutional pricing for their magazines..."
3255,"i'm 44 years old and have a solid middle-class income. my mom still insists upon keeping me on her family cell phone plan so that she knows she'll always be able to call me if she needs to.

3256,really more like maple syrup and cow shit.
3257,"i stopped last year, at 43. i have dark brown hair and have been seeing greys since my mid-20s, but in the last few years it has really ramped up. i was coloring my hair to reasonably closely match my natural color, but when it grew out you could definitely see where the color ended. 

in the end, i just quit, and focused on getting a haircut that made my grey look nice rather than frumpy. i'd been wearing a sort of non-committal shoulder-length bob for years, and ultimately i veered toward a floppy pixie with a pretty hard undercut. this did two jobs: it got rid of all the old colored hair, and it also made my grey really pop. so for me, the transition was mostly about finding the right cut, and the right stylist to make it happen."
3258,"i mean, i'm genuinely surprised to see gold astrological medallions coming back around, so i assume everything will eventually."
3259,"nice. i've had my copy for 30-odd years, it's tattered as hell. but i wouldn't give it up for anything.

3262,"i'm currently playing death stranding... i'm enjoying it, but it's *avant-garde* enough that i'm hesitant to recommend it. i could easily understand others finding it grindingly dull. 

but single-player, open-world rpgs are my jam. skyrim, fallout, dishonored, red dead redemption, etc. i don't just want a game, i want a vacation with superpowers."
3263,"i've had some good relationships, and some... not so good. and yeah, at this point i'm basically like, ""i mean, that was cool, but also i like playing video games for twelve straight hours without anybody getting on me about it, and i like using all the hot water, and i like having the whole bed to myself."" once my youthful drive to find a boyfriend waned, my attitude toward relationships has gotten a lot more distant. like you say, i'm just not convinced it's worth the trouble. 

the door is still open, but anyone trying to make it through is going to have to be *fucking awesome.* until that happens, i'm content to keep my own company, and i enjoy having things just the way i like them, with no need to confer with anyone else."
3264,"i'm a librarian in an academic library in northern new england, where winter is very much upon us. and i *wish* people who came in looked like this."
3265,"hell, you'll still find what is effectively segregation all across the country. just because it's no longer enforced by law doesn't mean it doesn't still happen every day."
3266,"yep, started library school at 36 with zero library experience (although i'd done a couple of years of book retail.) the people who are fucked are the ones who *leave* library school with no experience.

advice: do *everything* you can. a student job, an internship, at least one volunteer gig, a practicum, professional association service, any and all of it. it's easier to get varied library experience while you're in library school than it is at any other time.

i did some of all of it, and it was enough to get me my first professional job a month before i graduated. this can be done, you just have to be pro-active and pursue every lead you hear about. good luck!"
3267,"i shouldn't care, and intellectually, at least, i don't. but there's some little voice that says, ""but you'll smell like a dude..."" 

which isn't even a problem. but i'm at a stage in my life where i'm kind of reclaiming my femininity (in a not-very-girly sort of way) which seems to mean i'm hesitant to cross gender lines for myself. anyway, i'm working on it. thanks for the encouragement!"
3268,"yeah, this is a major problem i've had: everything just gets cloying once i'm wearing it. i'll venture into the unisex/masculine scents and try a few out. thank you!"
3269,"funny you should say that, one of the very few perfumes i own is bulgari the blanc. i love it, but it's more my ""special occasion"" fragrance. green tea is also lovely."
3270,"i think it's the spicy (as opposed to sweet) profile. something about my body chemistry is such that sweet-smelling fragrances just end up smelling sickly and a bit cloying on me, but sweetness is really prevalent in women's fragrances. i've found some toward the ""fresh"" part of the spectrum  that i really like, but men's fragrances are most often going in a totally different direction.

budget it pretty open. i'm not going to spend $1k on a bottle of perfume, but i don't mind spending $250 on something i really like."
3271,thank you so much for the recommendations! i'll make a point of hunting some of these down.
3272,"i'll do that, thanks!"
3273,"i have a sample of jazz club (i think that's by maison margiela?) which is a little sweet for my taste, but i still keep wearing it. i'll look for some of their others. :)"
3274,"i just caught a sample of chanel bleu this morning and thought, ""why can't women's perfumes smell this good?"" 

thanks for the tips!"
3275,"it dawned on me the other day that i just really prefer men's fragrances. i have a few women's fragrances that i like and wear, but i *love* a lot of men's fragrances. and it's weird, because i'm not generally that concerned about masculine elements in what i wear, but i have tended to shy away from clearly men's clothing and whatnot, mostly due to my own insecurities about coming off as a frumpy, genderless, middle-aged woman. (it's something i'm working through, but clearly not finished with yet.)

i know this is probably an unnecessary question, but what do y'all think about women wearing men's fragrances? do you ever do this? do you mix men's scent's with women's? are there any women's/unisex fragrances that might bridge this gap?"
3276,"i'll cop to it. worse, not only do i feel disappointed because things will change, i actually feel disappointed *in them.* like, as people. just a little, tiny bit. 

i like kids pretty much the same way i like all people. some of them are really cool, some of them really suck, and most of them i'm just indifferent to. i also know that most people aspire to parenthood, and the birth of a child is an occasion for joy. i get it, i'm down with all of it. i'm happy for them in that they get to do something that they really want to do. but as a childfree-by-choice, middle-aged woman, there's also a little part of me that feels... *""aw man, you too?""* most recently i felt this with a couple i'm friends with, but don't see often anymore (not related to the birth of their daughter.) i even knew that they really wanted to have a baby! it's not like they misrepresented anything, or that i didn't know this was in the plan. and i think their daughter is super cute, and i do often (though not universally) enjoy seeing their facebook posts about her, or about being parents, etc. but still that little disappointment was there, like i had hoped for more from them. it's irrational, but it's there. 

i have a cousin who, with his wife, had seemed like they were headed down the childfree, dink path -- they traveled a lot, did cool things, etc. but nope, now there's a baby. and he's a cute little fucker, too. i know they're all very proud and happy. but still it was there: disappointment as team childfree loses another one. 

anyway, there's no point to this except to say: yes, your feelings are real and normal, and i share them, too. it doesn't mean you reject them or their new offspring to feel that way. it's all okay.

the good news is, now i'm getting old enough that my friends who had kids younger are starting to have them leave home, meaning they're bored and looking for things to fill the void. and here i am!"
3277,"oh no, how sad. also, fuck cancer.

i used to work with the media co-op that lived in the basement at first congregational church up the block, and mary was always super supportive of the co-op's efforts. i live far away now, so i'm way outside the cooper-young/memphis loop, but i'm sorry to hear of mary's passing, and it's nice to hear that they'll keep the jc open. she worked hard to keep that place going, i'm sure it's what she would've wanted."

not to make assumptions. i just find all these japanese fashion words interesting and i want to make sure i'm understanding correctly."
3281,"there's a good deal of overlap between library science and information science, but no, is is not the ""next stage"" of ls. ls has a fundamentally different focus: librarianship is a service profession first and foremost, and the overriding concern is the need of the reader/user/patron. a lot of us do find these issues deeply concerning and/or interesting, but professionally we engage with them because they impact our users, and our users need to know about them. is  may also deal with them, but the needs of any user (except for maybe a corporate patron) isn't necessarily, or even probably, of any relevance. 

and no, you shouldn't get a phd in library science for this. the only reason you should ever consider a phd in ls is because you want to become a professor of librarianship. there are any number of schools with a much greater is focus; some of them may also have an ls program, but unless you want to be a service worker (in any of the forms that that can take) you needn't pursue library science."
3282,"i'm an academic librarian at a small, private liberal arts college, undergrad only. my area of professional specialization is film and video, and teaching. i don't actually have a second master's, but i do have a rough equivalent. 

1) the only times i would call my job ""stressful"" is when multiple projects are piling up all at once. and the beginning of each academic term can be a little bit harried, more because of faculty demands than because of students. but compared to jobs i worked prior to becoming a librarian, i'd be hard-pressed to ever consider my current job stressful. this could easily be because of the small, rather isolated nature of the college where i work. 

2) it varies. i might have a shift at the research desk, i might have a class session to prep or to teach, i might have a student or faculty research consultation. there are frequent, though not constant, meetings. the rest of my time is spent working on projects. right now i'm trying to finish off a video tutorial, prepping a last couple of class sessions for the term, and working on a massive deselection project. i'm also taking a course in instructional design toward a post-grad certificate, and i can spend some work time on that. 

3) mostly, yes. we do all have some evening and sunday shifts to work as well -- we all share them between us -- but i'm done with those for this term. we get a good bit of leeway on when we arrive and leave; general hours are 8:30 am - 5 pm, but it's not unusual for people to show up a bit late or leave a bit early, or even take a long lunch. we trust each other to be there when needed, to pull our own weight, and to ""comp"" any hours we take off during the day. but this is probably an unusually hands-off institution in that regard.

4) nope, not necessarily. if classes are in session and students are on campus, the library is open and we're working unless we take cto for that day. we do get thanksgiving, and the bit between christmas and new years, because that's the one time of the year when the campus closes completely. but we routinely work easter, independence day, most bank/mail holidays, etc. on the other hand, we get quite generous cto allowances, so if you really want a holiday off, you can generally get it without a problem. 

5) i mean, the best thing is when a student brings you a really interesting question, and you work together to devise a strategy through it. i do also enjoy teaching classes, although i usually dread them a bit in anticipation. one of those things where i don't want to do it beforehand, but enjoy the process once i'm in it, and am glad i did it afterward. 

6) the biggest obstacle will always be the administration. they say they care about the library, but they don't, or not in any way that helps us. also, 95% of the time, we have to do our primary jobs (teaching and supporting the academic mission of the institution) under constraints that make it essentially impossible to actually do really well. it's always ""as well as possible, under the circumstances."" that gets old, and frustrating. but it's the academic librarian's lot."
3283,"i'm not a school librarian -- i spent a couple of years working at a 9-12 boarding school, but i've never worked with younger children. so i have no insight to offer you there. 

but here's some blanket advice from someone with a bit of experience: you're not supposed to know how to do everything yet. library school is all well and good, but your real education starts in the trenches, working in a library. okay, you don't know how to bootstrap an entire school library right now... but after a year of doing it, you sure as fuck will. 

* let them decide if you're qualified to take the job; don't preemptively take yourself out of the running.
* it may be that these jobs are open because nobody wants to have to do all this stuff. but it makes a perfect dues-paying job for a new mls graduate, a place where you can learn a ton, prove what you can do, and get some practical experience on your resume for what's next. 
* even if you get it totally wrong, it probably won't be any worse than it is now. 
* personally, i think you should take as much practical experience (whether paid, volunteer, intern, practicum, whatever) as you can get, because a library science degree with no practical experience behind it will put you *way* behind when the time comes to go for the jobs you really want. 
* nobody ever feels like they know what they're doing in the beginning. don't let that stop you from giving it a shot.
* it's just library science, not rocket science. don't underestimate yourself.

good luck!"
3284,"you know, it never actually occurred to me that jk rowling made the librarian at hogwarts a pinch-faced, ill-tempered old bitch. like, why? why feed into that tired stereotype? especially when librarians have been such champions of the series? she seems like someone who would've been more aware; i feel like this needs to be rectified somehow."

3287,"also, the selection for silver tone jewelry is just sad in comparison. i get so tired of seeing rings and necklaces i love, but only in yellow or pink gold. i know metal tones come in and out of fashion, but when silver is out, it's waaaaaaay out."
3288,"if you live near (or within manageable driving distance) of a college or university, most will allow members of the public to come and use library resources inside the library. you'd want to make sure that the institution has the database you want to use, and that they let visitors in, but then you should be able to access most of their databases. 

also worth checking with the state library (although this database doesn't sound like one a state library would typically subscribe to), since they often provide some database access to residents separate from your local public library."
3289,"waze gets all its map/traffic data from google (and is owned by google) so that's going to be exactly the same. there just isn't enough of a user base here to guarantee reliable traffic data. it's okay in burlington, it's a little better on the interstate, it's all but useless out in the hinterlands. it's mostly fine for navigation, but definitely hit-or-miss on traffic."
3290,"okay, friend, have it your way."
3291,"i disagree with your assessment -- i think there's a ton in both the book and show to suggest that *many* people in the crew were seeing things that weren't there/perceiving things that did not exist, sometimes on a very concrete level and sometimes in more subtle ways. i think that alone is enough to suggest that we have a bunch of unreliable narrators and we shouldn't take any of what transpires, especially as the story progresses, as absolute reality. 

but, i mean, whatever you think is fine by me."
3292,"the franklin expedition really happened; they really got stuck in the ice, they (presumably) all really died, but it was unknown what precisely happened to them for decades afterward. 

the rest is a dramatization, based partly on what was suspected to have happened to them, and partly fictionalized based on inuit mythology and dramatic license. 

a major theory about what happened in the months that they were frozen in the ice was that the canned food they were eating was packaged improperly and was slowly inducing lead poisoning in the entire crew. lead poisoning *can* lead to hallucinations/mental decay, which is one read on the tuunbaq/pervasive murdery-ness of the crew... it wasn't actually happening, but it was how the crew, with their lead-addled brains, were perceiving the situation. but the show, and the novel on which it was based, were both ambiguous on this point. 

i believe more recent findings suggest that the crew wasn't really suffering from acute lead poisoning, but rather that they probably just got sick and starved/froze to death. we can't really know for sure, though. 

the remains of both ships have been found at this point, along with the remains of a few crew members. oh, and nobody knows whether crozier moved in with the inuits -- seems doubtful -- but i think that was just a way to give the story a satisfying ending.

tl;dr: yes, the expedition really happened, and everyone really died. don't take the rest of it literally."

3299,"i graduated from the emporia portland program in '13. it was... fine. the model was pretty good -- partly online, and partly face-to-face (which was great for building connections with people who are now also librarians.) the classes/instructors were hit-or-miss, and i have no reason to think that it's any different now. i don't know much about the denver program itself, but locations share many instructors, and emporia is adequate, if you're willing to put more into it than you're expected to. (library school anywhere is a get-out-what-you-put-in thing, so you want to throw yourself in, *especially* where the classes aren't as rigorous.) my emporia diploma hasn't hindered me in any way; i'm an academic librarian at a well-regarded private liberal arts college, and my office is next door to someone from a much fancier school. emporia is, as i said, fine. 

that said, there's a lot to gain from doing a ""hometown"" program if you can. that is, if you want to be in st. louis, and if the mizzou program will help you meet librarians in st. louis, that's not a bad thing. the fact that it's all online may not be the most conducive situation for networking, but even if it just helps you get into a good internship in st. louis, that could be helpful for after graduation. 

honestly, at the end of the day, any program that's ala-accredited will accomplish the same things, and the rest is up to you. i would probably recommend going with whichever program is cheapest/most convenient."
3300,"the era of collectors glasses from fast food restaurants was... weird, right? in the 80s, every kid i knew had a cabinet full of muppets/star wars/peanuts collectors glasses at home."
3301,"good: interesting questions, access to *so many resources*, can be a nice work environment. you may be paid a bit better than the average librarian, especially if you have an in-demand area of expertise (science, technical, etc.)

bad: never enough time to actually teach your subject matter, so you only end up teaching the basics over and over again and never get to the good stuff. constant budget constraints (although this seems to be universal across all libraries of all kinds), competition between librarians can be brutal, administration doesn't really give a shit about you or your library. 

ambivalent: if you're faculty, you may be required to ""publish or perish"" (this could be a great thing or a massive pain in the ass, depending on your preferences.) if you're staff, you'll always be disregarded to some extent, but you may also enjoy relatively high job security for minimal extra effort. 

i'm sure i'll think of more later, but these are the first things that came to mind."
3302,"find an institution you'd like to work at, and just ask them. they might say no, but i think you'd be surprised how often they say yes. 

look at it this way: you're near-professional, specially-trained labor that works for free for several months. every library i've ever worked in has had a backlog of projects that want doing, but that aren't high-priority enough for them to devote the resources to them. but here you are, already knowing most of what you're doing, willing to work for several months on a project at almost zero cost to them. they'll need to devote a bit of time and effort to supervising you and training you on the specifics of their systems, but that's a small price to pay, relatively speaking. 

when it was time for my practicum, i asked a major public broadcast archive on the other side of the country if they'd take me on, and they agreed quite readily. i ended up inventorying boxes of original tape recordings of a top-tier folk music festival -- stuff they didn't even know they had -- and laying the groundwork for a special collection down the road. i got a great project on my resume and a foot in the door on the east coast, and they got some much-needed work done for the price of some minimal supervision and the use of a vacant cubicle. it's a win-win for everyone involved."
3303,"good to know, thanks."
3304,"also, wool stays warm even if it gets wet. it's pretty great stuff. 

all natural animal fibers are going to be pretty warm; the difference is more about how *soft* the fiber is. any sheep's wool is warm, but it can be scratchy (and allergenic for some people.) merino wool (which is a sheep's wool from merino breed sheep) is softer, and less likely to cause itchy rashes. alpaca is softer still, and warmer, and all but completely hypoallergenic. fibers like angora, mohair, and camel can be incredibly soft and warm, but they're generally difficult to harvest and so they're generally prohibitively expensive (and in some cases, can be quite delicate and tricky to care for.) 

also worth noting that, generally speaking, the softer a fiber is, the more inclined it will be to pill. it's a trade-off. 

cashmere is sort of the happy balance for luxury natural fibers -- quite warm, very soft, rather expensive but not unreachably so. merino is the common man's equivalent. in either case, the more wool a garment has, the warmer it will likely be; if that wool is mostly merino, it will be soft as well; if it has some cashmere, it will be softer still. it just kind of depends on your ideal balance of warmth/softness/durability/expense. 

generally speaking, in real winter climates, the more animal fiber an sweater contains, the better it will be at keeping you warm and comfortable. synthetic yarns just don't do as good a job. beyond that, the differences will be more about how the item feels and how well it's made."
3305,"i don't work at an actual ive league school, but i work at an ivy-adjacent (let's say) institution, and have spent a lot of time with ivy league librarians.

pros:

* benefits tend to be quite good
* with a fat endowment supporting the school, there's somewhat more stability and job security
* budgets can still be constrained, but less so than at other institutions
* yes, having been at a prestigious institution can make it easier to move into other desirable jobs in the future
* access to everything.

cons:

* the faculty you work with can have an air of entitlement roughly equivalent to that of a russian oligarch
* the students, while smart/driven/thoughtful, can also be insufferably entitled
* be careful about the work environment. sometimes these places can be more peaceful than most because people are less worried about their standing; other times, they can be seriously fucking cut-throat.

one separate consideration: the regular rules don't apply to harvard, if that's the place in question. i've never worked at harvard myself, but have known plenty who did -- emphasis on ""plenty"" and ""did,"" and that should tell you something. turnover is high, and (unless you're an entrenched lifer) morale seems to be generally middling. it still looks good on a resume if you're not planning on staying for the long haul, but it's not as special as it seems like it would be. (it's also much more urban compared to any but columbia, and so much more expensive to live in the area.)"

3309,"thank you. it has bothered me for a long time: if *everyone* who is uncomfortable in a conservative christian context leaves the south, how will it ever get any better? i absolutely understand why it happens -- i did it myself -- but now that i'm older, and more patient, and angrier, and maybe a little more zen about getting along with people who think different or are even actively hostile to my beliefs (and, it should be said, past the age where access to an abortion is likely to be an urgent concern)... maybe i can go back and help out in some small way. and of all the southern states i've lived in, i think texas is the most ripe for change. 

i may come to regret this thought process, though. :)"
3310,"great piece, and yes, this rings very true to me. i've been lucky to have lived in at least one city with a ridiculously good food scene (portland, or), and while people in vermont *think* they have a good food scene, and they do do a few things well, on the whole it's very bland, and beige, and unchallenging. i'm lucky to live in a town with one of the better indian restaurants, and one of the better thai restaurants, but neither of those would rank higher than ""run-of-the-mill, strip mall lunch buffet"" in a large city. i miss having access to a wide array of great, authentic ethnic cuisines. hell, i miss being able to have a pizza delivered.

oh vermont... you're very sweet, but you're awfully dull."
3311,"
so, i'm actually looking at moving back to texas, from vermont. specifically, i'm looking at houston... vermont is lovely, and i understand why people love it, but it's just not for me. i need tacos, and queso, and people who are different from the universal wasp profile that vermont specializes in. i need modern conveniences and things going on, and a place where i can afford to buy a house eventually. i need a place where i can possibly bring my mother when she gets old(er). i would like to never shovel snow again. basically, i want the opposite of vermont.

i frequently wonder if i'm crazy for considering it, and i understand all that i'd be dealing with (i spent my childhood in texas, and much of my life in the south), and sometimes i think about the politics/religion and start having doubts. but i'd also like to rejoin the noble fight to chip away at the conservative christian bullshit factory from the inside.

anyway, just talking. good luck with your move. :)"

3314,"david benioff's dad was a former head of goldman sachs. dude ain't never parked a car in his life. and weiss was at least smart enough to attach himself to a rich kid. 

i too dream of seeing them humbled in the face of their hubris, but alas, i fear the rich always slip away unscathed. (or even get their own star wars franchise as a rward.)"
3315,people in the 70s always looked so... brown and leathery.
3316,"the closest thing that exists to ""god"" is a universal consciousness, of which we are each a tiny part... not just humans, but everything with any degree of sentience. and when we die, we take our accumulated experiences back to the mother consciousness and rejoin it, and become instantly aware of the reality of everyone else's experiences as well. every life is a data point, and so every life is equally meaningful and equally valid, and equally valuable to the universe's efforts to understand itself subjectively. 

i don't think that's what happens. but imo that would be the best of all possible final outcomes."
3317,"people who haven't spent much time elsewhere think it's great. people who've been to cities/places with great food scenes know otherwise. 

i mean, it's okay, it's fine, but i've yet to find anything here that was very special or distinctive. the cheese is good, the apples are good, sometimes people cook fern fronds if you're into forage-y kind of stuff. the ethnic cuisine scene is a yawning chasm on the whole. if you love food that's bland and beige and unnecessarily laced with maple, vermont might be just the place for you."
3318,"when i was a kid, my dad was an early adopter of bbses in the 80s, and i was *fascinated* by the idea that he could just talk to total strangers, anywhere, on his computer. i didn't understand it, but i knew for fucking sure that i wanted in. 

now that i've spent 25 years doing it... i mean, i don't want to go back, but let's be honest: this was probably a mistake."

3320,thanks!
3321,"typically speaking, a ""5 for $5"" sale can absolutely mean that you could also buy 3 for $3, or 1 for $1, or 12 for $12, or whatever. unless the ad/tag specifically states that there's a minimum or a maximum, or some other condition on the sale, it's common to see ""5 for $5"" used as a tactic to try to get you to buy five instead of one, but very often you can just buy one if you want to.

i don't know what the specifics of your situation are, but i don't think the customer was being fundamentally unreasonable here."

3323,thank you for the tip!
3324,"awesome, thank you!"
3325,"i believe all states are obligated to dispose of the bodies of indigent people when no next-of-kin is available. if there are resources, they'll take the resources to pay for it; if not, they just cover the cost of a cremation and that's pretty much that. 

interesting question, though! :)"
3326,"i did this when my dad died. he was a terrible narcissist, we'd been estranged for a couple of decades, and i'm his only child. 

my uncle (who'd recently been executor for two estates in the same state where my dad died) told me to tell the state/county officials that i was not taking responsibility for him. i had to submit a short letter stating as much, and requesting a pauper's funeral for him. i never heard from them again after that.

you might want to enquire in /r/legaladvice for specific advice for the relevant state, but generally  i don't think you're necessarily legally obligated to take responsibility."

3331,"no to gloves; yes to sweat, lots. i do use mats occasionally, though i wipe them down with sanitizing wipes beforehand. 

now that i think about it, i use physio balls a lot, and that's probably the one surface that my inner arms consistently come into contact with. i don't generally wipe those down (though i probably will now.)

these are also not raised at all... if i run my hand over my skin, it feels totally normal. it just looks like someone lightly misted me with pink dye."
3332,"syntrax makes a protein powder called nectar that comes in a number of fruity flavors, and they're all decent. i mean, they don't taste as good as real juice, but they're palatable, have a not-so-thick consistency, and they mix well with water. bit of a tendency toward floaties, but if you use a blender instead of a shaker bottle, i doubt it would be an issue."

3360,"for starters, the entire medical insurance industry (which is nothing more than administrators and sales people) could be transferred to the research and development of treatments and equipment for the care industry. rather than working to make money on illness, work to make money on prevention and treatment. if you have health insurance, you pay for it weather you use it or not. if you get sick, you still have more to pay. once you have spent all the money you have to pony up, then they might pay for your treatment, as long as they don’t have a reason to deny it. how is the continually rising price of insurance, therefore healthcare, sustainable?"
3361,"only a percentage of people infected will show symptoms or get sick, so people can walk around like little virus factories feeling just fine and they have been doing so for weeks. examples such as rand paul and boris johnson come to mind. the infections we are seeing are just the teeny, weeny tip of the testing iceberg. just because you can’t see it, doesn’t mean it isn’t there."
3362,the world will be slightly different with the culling of individuals. a lot like a filter on insta.
3363,"fair enough. sorry for that interpretation. but considering your circumstances, today you is less well off financially, and that doesn’t affect your optimism or sense of security? i’m not saying people would be having deep fundamental shifts, but i was really satisfied with how it looked like life was going and now i’m frightened for my family business and my family health like i never saw coming a month and a half ago."

3411,"just like you described. tomatoes and onions from these guys, herbs and lettuce from this farm, mushrooms from ...we picked up our own produce for years. talk to your local farmers market, you may be able to buy their leftovers wholesale. it’s not consistent, but it could be a convenient one-stop shop partnership that co-brands your restaurant with the growers. 
our restaurant has partnered with farms small enough to supply only us—we choose what they grow. but it is a patchwork."

3433,"those stupid people would still be alive if trump hadn't spent his time at the podium talking about a potential cure that is *not* a potential cure. he should spend his time at his podium assuring the public that the administration is doing all the right things to mitigate this disaster. he doesn't do that. his administration got rid of the people who knew how to handle a pandemic, so they have no reassurance to give.  what he *is* doing is making things much, much worse by lying to the public about the ""stolen"" ppe. his lies harm people, and your country, wether you ingest aquarium cleaner or not.

he lies, and misinformation matter. people are stupid, and some of those stupid people are listening to a malignant narcissistic liar who gives deliberate misinformation in order to protect his most important asset: his repulsive ego."

i get it, you want to see the world burn. i don't see how that will help, but you still have the freedom to choose for now.

if a progressive ever wins, you will still have to contend with the shittiest supreme court for the next 40 years. 

every step forward counts. every step back keeps you where you are."

sorry, didn't see the /s"

3445,"it's the supreme court that makes those decisions. the judicial branch.

the president is head of the executive branch. it has nothing to do with supreme court judgements.

if the republicans put one or more of their judges on the supreme court, every woman will lose her right to choose.

3466,"i'm canadian, so maybe my perspective can help. we have healthcare and it takes the pressure of bankruptcies off our backs. in fact, we can't even fathom how it feels to be you. sorry.

fox news lies about most of the stories i see on the cbc, or any other news service. in fact, fox is technically considered an ""entertainment"" channel. i've never heard a news slant as biased as fox.

i've been paying attention to politics since i was in my teens in the 80’s. the republicans started pandering to the religious right as tactical move to get more voters. they did this by making abortion a political wedge issue instead of a health decision made by a doctor and patient. 

give money to rich people, and they put it in foreign banks and give it to their children when they die.

give money to ""the people"" and they will sure as hell spend it. this is better for the economy.

if the republicans win this election, they will likely get two supreme court judges on the bench, and that will slant your society to the right for a generation, despite who wins the presidency. the right are currently packing the courts with right wing judges so they can continue making voter suppression laws, and gerrymandering districts.

thank you for listening to my speech."

i'm canadian, and i don't know what responses you mean."
3468,"governments are responsible for the safety and security of their citizens. they control all the institutions and laws that govern our responses to emergencies such as this one.

trump is the head of your federal government.

he is responsible for the emergency measures taken in this kind of situation. the buck stops with him.

he shut down the departments that deal with pandemics.

he doesn't have any experts left to give him good advice or any advice about how to handle this.

he is shitting the bed. every. single. day.

every day he shits the bed, means an exponentially larger number of people die from this pandemic.

he is personally responsible for every minute he refuses to take this seriously.

he has failed."

i said even a small portion of the money could be used else where to benefit your citizens, instead of foreign governments. it doesn’t have to tilt as far as it does in only one direction. for a society to be prosperous, it needs to have a more equitable allocation of taxes. 

you love your military, but others abhor it. why can't more money be allocated to  those who don,t support the military in the same way that you do? taxes are supposed to benefit society as a whole, not just one corner of it."
3525,"it's not really reputation at stake, it's literally fewer people to rent homes. it will be a supply and demand situation. too much supply, not enough demand. landlords who abuse tenants will be avoided, and rightly so.

these landlords are shortsighted and aren't thinking about the inevitable consequences of their actions. when the economy takes the hit that it has coming after the pandemic, they will be lucky to find tenants."

3531,"now would you like to list similar things trump has done? this is a ""whatabout"", so please, what are you comparing it to?

please submit two points to demonstrate how they both do repulsive shit. just two."
3532,"he didn't use the bully pulpit because he got elected to lead, not dictate. he wanted to pass bi-partisan laws.

i don't see trump supporters' behaviour as political engagement or passion.

it just looks like a bunch of angry, scared people who can't or don't want to question anything, so long as they can smirk at those they fear and hate.

not questioning democratically elected leaders isn't healthy. a democracy needs to move forward, and the voters are the ones who should be calling the shots, not lying to themselves and others just to feel less angry and scared. what kind of country are you trying to build? what does real progress look like? if your government only trades in rhetoric and populist messaging, it means they are robbing you blind on the back end. like a magician, they wave their hands over here, and take your watch from you over *there*.

i don't understand how america has come *so low* after only 200 years."
