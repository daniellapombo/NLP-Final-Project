blue ridge mountains, shenandoah river
life is old there, older than the trees
younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

country roads, take me home
to the place i belong
west virginia, mountain mama
take me home, country roads

all my memories gather 'round her
miner's lady, stranger to blue water
dark and dusty, painted on the sky
misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

country roads, take me home
to the place i belong
west virginia, mountain mama
take me home, country roads

i hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
the radio reminds me of my home far away
driving down the road, i get a feeling
that i should have been home yesterday, yesterday

country roads, take me home
to the place i belong
west virginia, mountain mama
take me home, country roads

country roads, take me home
to the place i belong
west virginia, mountain mama
take me home, country roads

take me home, down country roads
take me home, down country roads"

463,r/tosoon

616,definitely
617,ur mean
618,fine
619,but i really wanna know
620,yea i really am
621,just to be clear if they are 16 that means they can only date 15+?
622,i'm gonna ask
623,you need to get a life
624,lol
625,that's a awesome job
626,cool
627,why?
628,nope
629,what country do you live in?
630,awesome
631,cool what do you work as? (if you don't mind saying)
632,"i didn't do it personally but if i had to guess it was from a push by the local government to try and normalize it by having lgbt dedicated therapists, lgbt groups in schools and raising awareness of the issues facing lgbt"
633,yea that probably would be cool if it isn't in scotland yet but i'm not sure if that already exists in scotland i'm pretty sure str8 people can join it aswell
634,well in my area lgbt is pretty accepted and my school wanted to spread awareness of lgbt issues so they created a lgbt group and they put it up
635,oh lol didn't see sorry
636,yes
637,hello fellow haggis eater and kilt wearer
638,kool
639,"took it while walking past still not out of the closet and its pretty hard to explain why a ""straight"" person was taking a photo of it"
640,no my school is quite calm when is come to lgbt like a ⅙ of the students are lgbt. if you do bully someone for being lgbt you will probs be seen as a dick not cool like in other schools
641,"u?
if you don't wanna awnser that's fine"
642,a town near glasgow (not glasgow itself)
643,cool :)
644,yea all schools should have one. but then again my school is pretty chill about lgbt issues and lgbt in general
645,so about the image quality i took the photo while walking by (still not out of the closet)
646,you look cool dont put yourself down like that
647,without definitely
648,no obviously not idiot
649,speed
650,ok
651,"""a person that doesn't believe in a higher being (god)"" what do you define it as?"
652,neither do atheist that is massive profiling all atheists are are people that dont believe in a higher being
653,lol
654,i don't i'm just curious that's all
655,"massive profiling, also i don't i'm just curious to see just how hateful god is"
656,gladly
657,this is a trap js
658,"ok i'm fine with that i was just saying alot of people laugh at the word blasphemy it's like calling a gay person faggot it's just lost all value as a word, if that makes sense"
659,"i'm not the person you were talking to but you do know how childish you sound when you say ""blasphemy"""
660,hate to break it to you the bible isn't fact
661,"actually the correct translation if the bible is ""man shall not lie with boy"" it condemns pedophilia not homosexuality. if you don't believe me do your research, if christians even know what that is"
662,this is common knowledge nothing interesting about it
663,"you dont and there isn't, existence is meaningless and when we die it's just blackness"
664," ""the bible said adam and eve so i did both"" it's a bisexual thing"
665,oh ok
666,biphobic?
667,redbubble
668,well i am confused sooooo
669,i can't tell if i should downvote or upvote
670,tbh i don't know why
671,yea i know that but still they're advertising it
672,should probably clarify that this is because of all the police brutality going on in hk right now
673,"i just downvoted your comment.
 
# faq
 
## what does this mean?
 
the amount of karma (points) on your comment and reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## why did you do this?
 
there are several reasons i may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. these include, but are not limited to:
 
* rudeness towards other redditors,
* spreading incorrect information,
* sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## am i banned from the reddit?
 
no - not yet. but you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. otherwise i will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## i don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. can you un-downvote it?
 
sure, mistakes happen. but only in exceedingly rare circumstances will i undo a downvote. if you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what i got wrong. i tend to respond to reddit pms within several minutes. do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## how can i prevent this from happening in the future?
 
accept the downvote and move on. but learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on reddit.com. i will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. remember: reddit is privilege, not a right."

800,wow you're asking some really hard questions. first of all it is part cultural scotland has been a part of the uk for hundreds of years. but england definitely provides economic benefits to scotland also we dont need votes in parliament because we have our own that decides most matters. the snp party is very liberal so labour helps pass most defence/national questions. and ireland is very different from scotland in this scenario. also security wise we need england scotland could not defend itself against a foreign attack without english help especially since it would split the island in half
801,no u
802,"oh dear god ha. this is to say the least, controversial. my view is that we should stay in the uk for now and see how brexit works out if we get a deal i think we should stay part of the uk. if we don't and we leave with no-deal then i think another referendum should be held to see what the public think."
804,do you like mountains? cause ben nevis is a really nice one.if you're looking for countryside there is a really nice isle called isle of skye as for the coast probably the isle of arron. there might be some better place that i'm forgetting but i'll put them in the comments if i remember them
805,favourite season is probably summer cause we have hot ones. the best place is probably personal preference mine is edinburgh
806,cool

1418,sure
1419,10-aug
1420,"congratulations, you may have made a grave error but only time will tell"
1421,i think you posted this on the wrong subreddit pal
1422,"nah man, this a 100% cursed"
1423,"well, you donated money to the company to keep it in business, i heard they got fined a lot of money by china so you are helping them quit a bit. (also you'd have to have waited like a month or more to play it for free)"
1424,"wtf is ""kissanime.ru""?"
1425,goodnight... :/
1426,"idk man, i felt pretty close to telling op that the thing they were sad about was a non-issue"
1427,then why defend it?
1428,"yeah, i guess, but i believe cutting is the one of the worst ways of dealing with depression, other methods are better."
1429,"idk what you want me to say. hypnosis? better anti-depressants, anything is better than cutting your self to feel better (also if you know that people aren't lying to you about how great you are then why are you still depressed?)"
1430,does this shit happen often? am i broken? wtf
1431,then why did they did their brain melt?
1432,"so you're saying no matter how many times i reach out to help people it won't change anything? i don't believe it, these people often believe they did something wrong right? so wouldn't telling them the opposite (often the truth) be great for them?"
1433,"you messed their programming up and lost their ability to emote? this shit is unreal, if you feel bad about something you didn't know would happen (frankly something that shouldn't even be possible) then stop, it's not your fault, especially if you didn't know the consequences."
1434,"it feels like it, because the story you told is frankly rediculous, who cares about a pc that much? nobody"
1435,"idk what to say, people need to move on, i don't get it, is it some spell or something? everything that happen's to you is almost always a coincidence, people need to stop thinking the whole world is against them and think big picture, not about what some mean name and idiot called them.
but maybe i'm just stupid and don't know shit"
1436,"what the fucking shit? they were being sarcastic right? either they lied to you and you felt horrible for basically a harmless joke, or they care way too much about a pc, and option 3 is this is some stupid little joke you decided to waste my time with, it better not be the latter."
1437,"are you toying with me? you are being very counterproductive, i need straight answers, i can't help you with a vague story"
1438,"putting a dog down is the only solution we have nowadays when the dog can't be treated, and it shouldn't be like that we ought to find cures for the aliemnts that are so crippling. and yes you are hurting someone, yourself, and yes you are insane, you want to *hurt* yourself, i'm sorry but you need some serious help, and putting if off and saying i'm fine isn't helping you."
1439,maybe we could put them in a padded cell?  i feel like that would save lives
1440,"i hope so, welcome"
1441,yet you don't remember any of the specifics of the event?
1442,"well of course you are going to justify something that you yourself do, i think the problem is that people have a hard time getting over shit that doesn't matter in the long run"
1443,if you don't remember the details then you're probably just thinking you did worse than what you actually did
1444,"well i guess if you can try and work on controlling yourself, and if you can't, find someone who doesn't mind it"
1445,"so what, you're talkative? who cares that doesn't mean you're a bad person"
1446,then why do you care?
1447,uh no? people shouldn't be allowed to do things like that because they don't understand the gravity of what they are doing and need to be set straight
1448,just tell the whole story and i will tell you what i think
1449,i care :/
1450,"nobody should get beaten over the head for cutting themselves, but they should not be allowed to continue, they should see a mental health expert"
1451,"sucks dude, it really does, but what you need to leave them behind if they don't care about you, and find someone who does"
1452,how so?
1453,"if anybody is cutting themselves then they need some mental help, that's it"
1454,... how?
1455,"alright, just listen to the advice i gave you and try and find some online friends, please it's for your own good."
1456,oh yeah? what did u do?
1457,why u gotta enforce stereotypes? tsk tsk
1458,?
1459,now why would you want to do that?
1460,"many people on here want new friends anyway, i'm sure they'd be glad to talk to you"
1461,"that doesn't happen often dude, just try it"
1462,"so? you can have meaningful conversations with them, or play games with them, and maybe one day meet, also they are less likely to judge you based on how popular you are in a school or something, isn't that much better?"
1463,"yes you can, a lot of people on the internet would probably want to be your friend :)"
1464,"well friendships often fall apart after awhile, of she doesn't value you, then ignore her and try to find a new friend"
1465,"oh good, well i think this isn't something you should get too caught up on, you have a whole life ahead of you and will meet thousands of people, so don't worry if one of the first girls you find doesn't like you, plus relationships during highschool often don't last long, so like i said you shouldn't get too caught up on this"
1466,"oh, maybe censor the names tho"
1467,"spice it up, put ave maria and russia russia (lay that missile down)"
1468,we're done here
1469,sino-soviet split?
1470,"oh come on man, you can't drop out of the race, there are billions of people on earth, you'll find a good one :)"
1471,"that's fine, take all the time u need"
1472,gay
1473,well then you might as well tell me the whole story if you can't get your mind off of it
1474,⬆️
1475,"if it's that painful then don't bother, just relax, enjoy yourself, do what u like"
1476,"oh ok, i mean you're an adult so u can do whatever u want"
1477,i don't see a problem here
1478,"if you don't want to type then that's ok, just do whatever makes you happy and try to get away from what makes you unhappy (don't do anything too drastic though)"
1479,how did you get hurt? :(
1481,bro you have some serious problems
1482,... i think you need professional help
1483,"nah man, no amount of holy water can save you now"
1484,must be because you aren't part of the kool kids klub
1485,*claps* left 4 dead 2

1575,"well, i think those kids have an addiction to porn, and having an addiction to anything is usually bad."

1654,bruh
1655,you can't just give a tank something it didn't have... wait nvm practically nothing in this game is life-like except the graphics
1656,what do you mean?
1657,r/okbuddyretard
1658,"i'm sorry, what??"
1659,why? do things like tog gun give you extra experience?
1660," ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, i didn't understand the definition, thanks for explaining it!"
1661,nah the game went on for quite awhile after i died
1662,yeah but i didn't meet the requirements for it :/
1663,"well that's just straight up not true, thanks tho"
1664,"""master gunner:

score at least five armor-penetrating hits in a row against enemy vehicles. a series unbroken by a miss, non-penetration, or ricochet continues in the next battle using the current vehicle. every vehicle has its own series. only the longest series is included."""
1665,that song is straight fire
1666,damn
1667,i'll drink to that
1668,whut
1669,"i was saying it's funny, but not true, which is the joke, right?"
1670,"he didn't surrender to the allies, he just shot himself and then the war continued on."
1671,what happened in feb again?
1672,"damn, true tho"
1673,"idk, why did you say ""what'"
1674,"don't worry, i upvoted"
1675,"lmao, sure"
1676,"this story doesn't sound realistic, but if you're not lying i wish you luck, won't give you an upvote tho"
1677,"oh, didn't know"
1678,"there's only two puppets and india, that's what i'm talking about nitwits"
1679,"corny, but i'll upvote"
1680,you mean three right?
1681,"yes, yes, but i still doubt a nuke on the long 15 would kill of the legion, they've made it quite awhile before they found the ncr"
1682,"to texas then! also that whole midwest being a radioactive dustbowl is one of the dumbest plot contrivences i've ever heard of, did the chinese nuke all the farmers?"
1683,"why can't it just move east? like march on louisiana, this is dumb"
1684,stealz
1685,oh no
1686,"doubt it, go and prove it"
1687,it does? how?
1688,wait what?
1689,"nah, bunch of alabamaians with lasers, that's about it"
1690,why not?
1691,nice repost
1692,ok
1693,so a f*cking normal person? what??
1694,"you responded quickly, it has been? wtf does it mean then?"
1695,can we stop making up 500 words everyday to make people feel unique? thanks
1697,"welp, guess we'll wait for scientists or psychologists to find a way to fix mental illness and in the meantime stop people from mutilating themselves, or somethin :c"
1698,"uhh, telling them are not mentally sound and try to convince them that they are wrong? :/"
1699,isn't the suicide rate for people with gender dysphoria the same even after they get the surgery? even that solution doesn't seem to help that much
1700,"alternatives to not changing everything about your body? i'm not sure, but we'll find a way, i've heard a lot of people nowadays are being told they are trans when they really aren't, and they're people just growing out of the whole trans thing and just accepting who they are: a dude or girl who just likes stuff that isn't ""normally"" what they're supposed to like."
1701,"i feel like this is a trap. but i think it's just a run of the mill mental illness and we probably shouldn't go along with whatever trans people believe.
sorry if i sound mean :("
1702,"nah man, this is the hill i'm dying on, stop using so many fucking emojis"
1703,still a repost m8
1704,... whatever floats your boat
1705,what about spain? :d
1706,"ok, now shut up"
1707,what's with all the emojis? tone it down
1708,good bot? it's the same damn post
1709,oh yeah? so what's your opinion?
1710,"this is the most shameless repost i've ever seen, this is sad"
1711,good job dude!
1712,"this is a bad joke, it's pajama day, ""not what you wear to sleep"" day"
1713,i wonder what the first person who reposted a meme said
1714,yeah well it ain't very historical >:c
1715,"germany can spawn tigers from berlin in 39', and often they make a lot of panthers, so this guy in his go-kart is just sad"
1716,"bruh wtf is this shit, the uk and france did it to by time for war, jeez. this is stupid"
1717,good to know aliens are investing in earth
1718,"holy heck, best of luck dude"
1719,"the ai placed a general on a one stack light tank, i assume you guys aren't wc4 players, but that's a pretty crap unit to put a general on."
1720,wouldn't them posting a ww2 meme on a weekend mean they *don't* know the rules?
1721,"honestly that whole place is a joke, just start in goodsprings, and get onto those mountain/hills to the left most part of the map, go north until you're above that sacked camp thing, kill all the cazadores by raining down grenades with a grenade launcher (or just pistols if you have time to spare) once they're are all dead just hop down and walk to vegas."
1722,"ok, what do u want me to make?"
1723,no
1724,hey man have you tried to build a spaceship while the rest of the world is getting nuked? exactly
1725,"the front door says vault 92, that's about it"
1726,great job
1727,i think this is a war crime
1728,but it said spanish :/
1729,i'd die of boredom if i was forced to play australia in any conquest (maybe 1943 would be good)
1730,when you take too much jet
1731,"bruh i shoot up the gun runner factory and he still gets new guns and ammo, it's robo witchcraft"
1732,wow bro that looks great! is this a mod?
1733,"yeah, well there's not much you can do about other than what i said, bombing maybe gas. i'm just hoping easytech adds more to ew6 1914 like a 1917 or 1918 conquest"
1734,"yeah, my ottoman game in 1914 took like 110+ turns"
1735,"try using bombers, a lot of them. 

also the ottomans dont get tanks if i recall correctly"
1736,why does master oogway look so mad in this version of the meme?
1737,"i'm not sure, i sold him to get guderian... lol"
1738,"true, but i doubt i could've held paris with any old heavy tank"
1739,"only messe, guderian and leeb?! i only had the last two and i just finished all the 50s conquest.  i played as portugal last and it was a bitch, best of luck bro."
1741,"i've been doing a portugal 1950 conquest for about 110 rounds now, so idc how long it takes, but it would probably be better for a quicker country, like what verallity said"
1742,"i would apply to be a mod, but i've only been here for about a week, so :l"
1743,"nah man, raise california to the ground"
1744,coronavirus united front
1745,"nah, if germany went to war with poland it would be pretty close but germany would still come out on top"
1746,"yeah... but in math .999... is 1, so it's all bs"
1747,"bruh it's a joke, wtf"
1748,"tsk, i hate when people give up at the start of a match"
1749,"it's like putting down a headless chicken, don't worry about it"
1750,"i've had the same problem, maybe each country has a max tax limit or something"
1751,"no idea, i'd assume it will after a little while."
1752,"i didn't mean to insult you i was just saying it makes the conquest tedious, not challenging, but we can agree to disagree, you put a lot of work into the mod and i find that pretty respectable."
1753,"i guess? i've never used him, all i can say is that messe did a pretty good job for how much i paid for him"
1754,cause he's a pretty good starting tank general
1755,"i could've sworn i had already upvoted this, wtf"
1756,i'm pretty sure it's places without terrain effects
1757,bruh the only problem here is someone calling an m103 a pershing
1758,you do realize the $ sign goes before the amount right?
1759,i got leeb and he and messe did pretty good
1760,thanks
1761,what's the mod?
1762,sorry but i can't really do that lol
1763,i don't work for easytech so i have no clue
1764,"reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepost, thank you"

1771,"never heard of it, do you have a link to it?"
1772,"i'd hold out until i unlock rockets, then i usually blow up the enemies cities and parachute in, sometimes i have to build units to guard the city, but eventually, you wear the enemy away and you win."
1773,technically it's one picture now :)
1774,"i'm confused, wouldn't the original ""add user"" be there as well?"
1775,"is that an emoji? 

sad"
1776,isn't this a repost? ah fuk it whatever
1777,"oh my bad fam, continue the good work"
1778,\>doesn't even own taiwan
1779,"hmmm, lets go with poverty"
1780,hope you get annexed by spain
1781,i physically struggle to get up every morning
1782,i’d rather pm if that’s okay
1783,"i’m not white, and i only pointed that out because everything else op said seems fair to me"
1784,"ohhhh i feel like i misread it at first sorry. 

everyone can be loved regardless of their flaws! abs happy cake day"
1785,fess up
1786,i figured out how loading screens worked too!
1787,as opposed to being liked by a girl? or are you just saying in general
1788,in the end “fetish” is just a word for a sexual preference. how things are defined are arbitrary
1789,i notice you say you like white boys but then are mad at the fact that others have a specific race they like? is that intentional or
1790,the one closest to the plate. period.
1791,gotta wish her belated happy birthday
1792,oh shiiii
1793,izze and sprite
1794,i think it really depends on the context because it all depends on what is being said. in the end there is a line that can be crossed. but i completely get what you’re saying
1795,"people legit do

proof: ksi"
1796,bro different opinions! that’s crazy wtf!!!
1797,this looks amazing!
1798,kobe was end of january but ya
1799,🏀🔥💯
1800,truth
1801,dont help him
1802,cum on now it’s pretty easy to seemen online
1803,there are also many absolutely shit subreddits.
1804,and there’s one in a thousand posts here on r/teenagers which are original and humorous or relevant
1805,i have a feeling girls on reddit have a lot more weird dms than boys do
1806,i’m indian as well and i found this one amazing dude so no ur wrong
1807,oh no a different opinion!!!!!??!!?!!??!!!
1808,myron by lil uzi vert
1809,by not cutting
1810,didn’t miss anything
1811,i admire the dedication. the rhyme scheme and flow remains on point. good work!
1812,lil uzi vert dropping his album and then the deluxe
1813,copy pasta
1814,no. tiktok has more people reposting trends and stuff than the reposts in meme subreddits. i don’t hate either tho
1815,logics new album is so bad other than a select few songs i was so disappointed. i actually loved bobby tarantino ii and some of his old stuff. a shame he now has lyrics like “i’m biracial only in my penis” and “i don’t give a damn bout lyrics”
1816,if i use a knife while cutting some vegetables or smthng and then someone gets stabbed and died at the same time. by your logic i made them die
1817,rap
1818,love yourz
1819,it’s not weird wtf. also being weird doesn’t mean it’s broken
1820,if a black person tells a white person yo not say the n-word it makes sense. same ting here
1821,"it’s really not a mindfuck. ultimate statements don’t work but the idea of an ultimate statement makes sense. 

its literally just telling someone not to day a word lmfao"
1822,username checks out
1823,"being a hypocrite doesn’t break the meaning of the statement. breaking a statement means it doesn’t make logical sense.

in your example (forget the “like me and your mother” part that’s extra and is not reflective of the original statement) even if i’m a hypocrite. the message is still clear"
1824,that sounds fucked up
1825,i have my teachers instagram
1826,i know ur joking lol but errr for arguments sake. being a hypocrite doesn’t mean the statement is broken
1827,"ayyy! j cole is my favorite artist so i’ll recommend a few more from him:

false prophets

atm

change 

deja vu

middle child"
1828,but in this case it is not referring to yourself. you’re telling someone else to never say never. obviously you’ve said it twice but that’s only in the context of educating others not to use it
1829,j cole - kevin’s heart
1830,"it literally doesnt. the definition of the word u shouldnt say is irrelavant.

if i say:

never say “you are a shitty person”

does not mean i’m calling you a shitty person


if i say:

never say “i hate dinosaurs”

doesn’t mean i hate dinosaurs. just means don’t say that"
1831,seems like you phrased it perfectly
1832,you’re amazing as well :d
1833,he forgot
1834,valid concern
1835,"never say _____ means don’t say the word. regardless of what the word means.

if i say “never say ever” if literally just means don’t say “ever”

so “never say never” literally just means don’t say “never”

the definition of the word that should not be said is absolutely irrelevant.

thank you for coming to my ted talk 

lol"
1836,hide
1837,well it definitely is an unpopular opinion.
1838,i agree with everything in your post!
1839,i totally just read that wrong my bad. well.. explicitly tell him ur gay if u haven’t yet
1840,yes
1841,y’all are cheesy. but i absolutely hate it when someone has a serious post (with the serious flair) asking honest advice or ranting and y’all just put some ignorant comment it’s fucked up
1842,"i don’t think acting gay around someone is a good idea. but at this point just tell him you don’t like him like that. yes he will feel heartbroken but after some time he’ll be alright.

better to tell him sooner rather than later"
1843,a tiktoker
1844,yeaaaa u right
1845,yea but one persons opinion doesn’t reflect everyone’s. this is a new experience and people miss their friends or just the social interaction of being at school

1889,so essentially what you’re saying is gender is a spectrum. first correct thing you’ve said tbh
1890,because i’m sane
1891,turn off notifications for that app
1892,why are you fucking pizza
1893, you contradict yourself. you accept trans people but then say people with different tendencies shouldn’t identify as the opposite gender

also yea basically every sports league.

ww3 was a meme but nukes are real so i don’t rly get your point lol. ofc it won’t affect you unless a war actually began"
1947,"well it’s unfair not to count kobe’s death. it’s not every year that an athlete with worldwide influence dies an unexpected death ay a relatively young age.

also us killing qasem solemani

australia fires 

olympic about to be postponed

2103,thanks for making my point about views
2104,sigh
2105,lala
2106,cringe
2107,that’s not what i’m getting at. i’m talking about the people who already have hundreds and hundreds of upvotes. and consistently post often on their reddit “get my karma up” what is the point of having 80 followers and liking them when they cause problems because people send inappropriate messages and can risk stolen information. now i’m bringing a whole new reason on why u don’t get it. they can risk other people gaining information on them
2108,agreed
2109,read my post

you say you don’t care about upvotes you just like them. i can easily say i don’t care about views i jut like them

you say upvotes can make your day. but views can make my day (and they did once).

you say people don’t get anything from views. but do you get anything if i upvote this comment rn? nope"

2202,i’m sorry you had to go through that but this title is simply arrogant and snobby and just overall not thoughtful. your hardships cannot be compared to someone else’s and vice verse. you don’t have to attack others’ suffering to introduce your own obstacles in life.
2203,"it’s okay, jordan was too"
2204,"to answer your title question, no"
2205,"the first misconception here is this:

the word simp means one thing, and it’s overused or misconstrued other ways. simp itself, when used correctly is fair. it doesn’t just mean too nice. it means someone who changes their values or overworks himself to get with a girl who shows little interest.

now your point might be that people use the word in situations in which it’s not valid and that would make sense. but attacking the word itself makes no sense since it in itself is not an inaccurate or attacking word"

instead just let them know you’re there for them and listen to everything they have to say. remain optimistic and let them know you’re understanding what they’re saying. essentially you’re giving them a figurative shoulder to lean on."

2441,no
2442,"yea the other things can get boring but try to find something else like a sport or instrument or literally anything which seems interesting. 

like for me i love sports a lot and so do my friends so we never run out of interesting things to talk about and i feel really grateful for that.

i know it’s definitely a lot easier said than done though, and i hope the best for you"
2444,"yes but what they’re saying is don’t be harsh for making the mistake, that doesn’t mean you don’t realize the mistake. it’s a difference between being made at yourself for doing something wrong and realizing you did smthng wrong and learning from it"
2445,comes from sporangium or something rare
2446,i look forward to small things like weekends or seeing friends at lunch or watching nfl

2450,"this a cool school diss for sure

school life passes in a blur

blurry like eyesight with glasses

don’t be salty, or sugary like molasses

molasses more asses moles and lasses

maybe i should study to pass my classes

i read that, i read this, i read it and reddit

maybe i should stop procrastinating before i regret it"
2451,sorry

2457,"anything but a seahawk, raven, or falcon"
2458,"just don't let bernie reduce doctors' wages (which medicare for all would do). they work for 12+ years after high school to get into >$300k debt, usually not making money until they're in their early 30s. and yet people say doctors are overpaid after that, even with the immense effort they put into their work. it's crap"
2459,what could you possibly have done
2461,depends on your height and musculature
2462,quality meme
2463,that's pretty epic
2464,"what are you then, attack helicopter?"
2465,i may be simping but i am fine with that lol
2466,indeed
2467,well shit. i take ibuprofen every day. not gonna stop now
2468,"that happens to me too. i asked my mom about it before (she's a doctor) and she said it's heat rash (aka prickly heat), and it's pretty common. not harmful, just annoying af."
2469,"would about the reverse, anything?"
2470,that's unlikely to happen during this pandemic :o
2471,maybe you're the boyfriend ;)
2472,what was that random v in there
2473,thicc af
2474,"i'd say wait a couple years. you're much more mature then, including physically"
2475,did you make sure to say full homo?
2476,i'm a quiet kid and i'm offended. the only thing i keep in my duffel bag is an ak-47
2477,steal his girl
2478,i'd prefer more like 2010-2014
2479,i love it because it isn't so bitter
2480,r/nofap?
2481,"oh, really? if that's true that's great– i was planning to apply for a scribe position this summer (if this whole corona thing is past by then). i'll look into it. thanks!"
2482,"yeah, i understand how it would be preferred over passive shadowing– but can you list it as shadowing on the amcas? because i figured it would not be seen positively if you have zero shadowing and only include scribe work. i'm still a first year in college so kind of a noob."
2483,do you know if it matters which language you're proficient in? because i know a pretty useless language in the united states (czech) that is only spoken by about 10 million people worldwide. i'm thinking spanish might get you a better advantage?
2484,"scribing doesn't fall under the category of shadowing, or so i've heard."
2485,"hey, make sure to plan out free time just for leisure. if you don't, you won't stick to your schedule because you'll burn out trying to start so many new difficult habits at once."
2486,"yeah, that's not on there. i took the test last year"
2487,"no, i understand. i've lived in europe but have spent the majority of my life in the us, where i live now. and for that reason, i also hate it here lol"
2488,at least us doctors get the big bucks
2489,*wait a minute*
2490,"patrick, think harder!

uhh.. fum is cum"

2493,my next birthday i will no longer be a teenager. yikes
2494,happy einstein birthday and stephen hawking deathday
2495,fuck you by lily allen
2496,"i have, yes– when i was a freshman i admired a junior who had his life together– had good grades, a good personality, confident, had a magnificent mustache. he ended up going to cornell. he was super rich though (got a maserati for his 16th bday) so that might have contributed to his success, through the clout of his parents"
2497,"actually, what i would advocate for is just keeping us on dst year round, and eliminate standard time. that way we have extra daylight all year long and don't have to deal with annoying time changes."
2498,my mom literally works in a hospital that had a corona patient. if i die i die
2499,"i understand you. i used to have someone i could talk to about literally anything, and someone who could always comfort me when i felt bad. but not anymore"
2500,not getting over my addictions...
2501,"thanks, you're right– delayed gratification is a skill. you keep it up as well!"
2502,"sophomore year. had a girlfriend, lost virginity, was successful in music and in school, still had living grandparents. had an awesome dog. was starting to eat healthier and exercise. but no longer"
2503,who are you and what are you doing here
2504,"hey, i live in georgia. you mean voting for the democratic candidate? how do you do this? i've already registered but idk how to actually vote"
2505,lil piece of shyte
2506,oh shoot i remember when i was 15 getting my permit. seems so long ago now wtf
2507,"i don't care much for what every girl thinks of me. i only go for ones i'm super attracted to, so i've only had one girlfriend. that relationship lasted for three years, though. best thing that ever happened to me, really loving someone"
2508,"that's what i thought simp means. short for simpleton, as in a guy who obsesses too much about girls"
2509,"every 60 seconds in africa, a minute passes. we can put an end to this."
2510,"6'2... not sure about that whole thigh thing though lol

short girls have pretty decent thighs if you ask me"
2511,simpleton
2512,"take schoolwork seriously. it may seem dumb, but you can save a buttload of money just by putting some effort into what you do. in the future, you can apply for scholarships and maybe even get paid to go to university."
2513,it's not disgusting if you enjoy what you do and you're not hurting anyone.
2514,"i'm working hard to get into medical school for the next 3 years, so hoping to become some kind of doctor in the future"
2515,there's a party at my professor's house tomorrow. girls and guys gonna be having fun lmao you can come by if you live within 1000 miles. probably won't get raped.
2516,"it's a honda accord hybrid. i didn't want to go the prius route because that thing is ugly lmao

looks you're interested in this sort of technology, so i guess you'd like an electric or hybrid car in the future?"
2517,my car uses regenerative braking. it's a hybrid and i love it so much.
2518,how about i don't become a registered sex offender
2519,"oh no, i don't get offended. i laugh at all the soviet memes along with my mom, but i just wanted to share how people actually lived back then lol"
2520,"my mother grew up in a communist country. they stole my family's business and property and relocated them to a small, sterile apartment building. the country's not communist anymore after 1991, but we never got our property back. not a pro gamer move."
2521,"i'd ask you out, but i don't want to break your heart in the future."
2522,"i agree there are some advantages. but i've never attracted someone just because i was tall. i had a girlfriend a couple years ago who was more than a foot shorter, and she just found it annoying. when you're really good at something and passionate about it, that's what sets you apart from others. little to do with physical traits. they can be beneficial for initial talking points, but not much beyond that. honestly, who focuses on height as every point of conversation, every day? people just stop noticing once you've known them for a while unless you're ridiculously tall or short."
2523,is this satire
2524,i'm tall but life is still bullshit when you can't do what you want because you have intense physical pain everywhere
2525,"can't help millions of years of evolution and our biology, unfortunately.
i wish i didn't care about sex or girls. it would make life so much easier."
2526,talk about how you fucked your crush just by t-posing on her
2527,thank you for this profound piece of wisdom
2528,"if you're on mobile you just go to the r/teenagers homepage, tap on the three dots at the top right, and change user flair"
2529,aw shit lol
2530,wish my parents cared. i get all a's but my parents don't care. if i ever made a single b though shit would go down
2531,hook me up i'm probably older lmao
2532,"my entire being hurts randomly sometimes, inside and outside."
2533,where you from? it's only 9:30 pm where i am
2534,"yeah, men on average live shorter lives than women."
2535,"same here! this is the longest streak i've been on for over a year. taking it seriously now. keep up the grind, brother!"
2536,"is everyone here trying to never masturbate again, or just never watch porn again? i thought the reason everyone feels so terrible was because porn changes your brain for the worse. i was under the impression you don't masturbate for around 90 days to facilitate the brain changing back to its normal, pre-addiction state, and it shouldn't be a problem to masturbate normally without porn after you recover. does masturbating without porn still cause these same problems? just genuinely curious."
2537,"i know someone who was accepted to harvard but chose to go to uga instead. clearly, not a bad school"
2538,"i would refuse to go to detention if it's for something i didn't do. i don't care if i'd get in more trouble, i'm not taking that shit."
2539,"lies, girls are way cuter. i really need to get myself a girlfriend... most girls i see are lookin like snacks lol but i haven't dated in two years. you?"
2540,"sorry, i'm a slight grammar nazi lol"
2541,never written* music before.
2542,my dad's a psychiatrist. he says you have ligma.
2543,"i dunno man, i think boob jiggle gets pretty annoying too. along with your vagina bleeding and causing you pain every month."
2544,same my homie. what are you majoring in?
2545,*unlimited power*
2546,ahh i feel that. haven't dated anyone since i broke up with my girl about 2 years ago. i just need someone new to love now hnnng
2547,just spreading awareness lol. anyways i don't think the fbi would approve of a relationship between you and me lmao
2548,dude you know 5.5 inches is above average and 5'5 is below average right? i read it's 5.1 inches and 5'9 average respectively for each.
2549,"beginning of a journey for you. good luck, i'll be ending mine soon."
2550,i don't think the fbi would approve of that between you and me.
2551,"i made some actual friends in college. we have similar goals in many ways, which is great because i felt alone in high school– just having surface level friends."
2552,"you're not fully developed, you have angsty teen urges, and with maturity you won't have these thoughts anymore– at least not nearly as much."
2553,"yes, i say play with her tits instead"
2554,"try google opinion rewards. that one is legit, though i've only made $18.14 so far over the span of 11 months."
2555,"damn, i'm 19 and he looks healthier than me in that picture."
2556,i found you by sorting by controversial lol
2557,it really is. my dad's a psychiatrist and he has loads of free time while still getting paid the good medium-sized bucks.
2558,"man, for some reason it always felt like i look slightly more attractive immediately after orgasm-- i look like i have a sort of ""glow"", but then it quickly fades and i feel much worse than i did 5 minutes ago. i agree  though that ultimately we all do look better after abstaining from pmo for a while, and the body gets used to not wasting its energy."
2559,"according to one of the books that catalyzed the nofap movement, your brain on porn, porn does repress your emotions. it's worst if you started using porn during puberty, because that's when the brain creates the most tightly knit neural connections. a powerful part i read (paraphrasing) is: ""porn dampens your emotions. and that means all your emotions, even your positive ones. recovering from this addiction means facing the emotions you've repressed for a long, long time. "" but it's worth it in the end– when you can finally feel those powerful positive emotions again, and you can find joy in the small parts of life again."
2560,"ha, i like your height. nice."
2561,"i live in georgia right now, and i hate the high heat and humidity. you like alaska more? from what i've seen, despite the cold, it's beautiful there, no?"
2563,"hey, so i actually got the kindle a day early and i've already tried it out. the oasis definitely has better, much more even lighting and the amber leds work very well. using calibre, it was really easy to convert all my ebooks and transfer them to the kindle. there was no issue in the formatting or spacing of the text when going from epub to azw3.  using overdrive to send a borrowed library ebook to the oasis wasn't an issue either since i live in the usa. page turns are also noticeably faster on the kindle due to the faster processor, although i do think it has worse (but still good) battery life than the libra. i think it was worth it to spend the extra 80 bucks for the even lighting, premium build quality, and the amazon operating system."
2564,"sure, i'll let you know when it arrives on friday. first thing i'm going to do is convert a couple of my books."
2565,"thanks for letting me know! it seems they all have screen issues. i think i'll just return it and get a kindle oasis, because lighting doesn't seem to be an issue on those. unfortunately they're just so expensive and i'll have to convert all my ebooks to the amazon supported formats..."
2566,when you fail at getting upvotes
2567,do it! if you start today you'll be at 30 days by the new year.
2568,"thing is, i'm actually 19 irl which is epic"
2569,"what makes you think immigrating isn't worth it? life here in the us is not nearly as glamorous as people make it out to be. low quality food (for average people), lack of vacation time, excess stress culture, high obesity rate, terrible healthcare, gun violence, highly flawed education system etc. here in the us is quite terrible."
2570,"what about outside of prague? i have family in olomouc; do you think that area is at risk as well? i live in the us but i just love the czech republic, and don't want my family there to struggle"
2571,nah i'm good lmao
2572,"being tall does not make you happy... trust me.

it's all about your attitude. what you believe is your reality"
2573,"it's the same in czech. more commonly people use ""tvoje matka"", i just chose ""tvá"" because it's shorter lol

i'm guessing twoja stara is something like ""your old woman""?"
2574,yeah it's czech lol
2575,err... mine means your mother in another language?
2576,this reminds me of when someone gave bill gates several gold and platinum awards
2577,"damn, i'm so jealous... i wish i could get some czech food here. but alas, i live in the usa"
2578,*oh no*
2579,i presume they are committing the racism
2580,"i'm a freshman chem major... did well in gen chem i, and i am starting gen chem ii next semester. i'm taking orgo i in fall 2020. am i in serious danger? how was it compared to gen chem? 


everyone hypes it up to be so terrible i'm scared"
2581,"holy moly twice a day, every day? alone that's gotta be really expensive. and tough on your guts. 



...but damn i wish i were you lmao


i wouldn't say anything. the higher ups make plenty of money, and the employees there all make a flat rate"

2587,gay luigi
2588,"if you can do well in ap physics, you can definitely do ap chem— most peoples' opinion is that chem is harder than bio. and physics is harder than chem. this was the case for me, too.
i'm also pre-med, but i'm currently retaking chem and bio in college despite ap credit, because you need to know those subjects really well for the mcat, and you don't want to mess up your gpa jumping straight into gen chem 2 and gen bio 2 when you don't have a solid foundation."
2589,if you hadn't commented i wouldn't have noticed lmao
2590,"for the first time in 300 years,  halloween falls on friday the 13th next year."

2593,hey! i've been to that exact location and taken the same pic. i live in the usa. this is quite a deja vu moment lol
2594,good
2595,"i'm turning 19 in a couple months. and yeah i do feel fortunate that i had an introduction early on to healthcare. it does help to know what being a doctor is all about, being in contact with two of them regularly– my dad's a psychiatrist as well."
2596,"lmao my mother is an emergency doctor and always, after work she comes home and watches crime tv shows. like, she comes home from saving lives and then watches shows about murder. it's epic"

2604,"bruh i'm not a 2004 kid but...



i was born in 2000




i'm gonna be 20 in 2020 wtf"
2605,"actually, yes, it was hardest for me. that's just because i took hard classes... the worst being ap chemistry lol

it's also when i had to end one of my hobbies and relationships, both for causing me pain in different ways oof


but yeah junior year is important because it's the last year colleges will see your grades for when you apply, unless they require a mid-year transcript in senior year (but that's rare). so in that way it is a grind lol"
2606,"the very start isn't bad. the teachers just start you off with explaining how their classes work, so nothing major happens right away. they give you some time to get used to things...
it's honestly not that bad as the years go on. you can make lots of new friends, figure out what you want to do with your future, and have fun if that's what you're looking for lol"
2607,"it sort of is. some of the students would do anything to come out on top as valedictorian or to compete for top scholarships/ universities. at least, my school was like that, but my school was one of those competitive magnet high schools"
2608,"yeah thanks :)
high school relationships are tough– especially if your parents are keeping you apart. but i say go for it! if you find someone you really like, it's worth it"
2609,"we were both really awkward and attracted to each other, so we'd been dating for like 6 months before we felt comfortable enough to kiss. i was 16, she was 15. it was halloween night, and her parents were outside handing out candy, so we had the place to outselves for a few minutes. i looked into her big beautiful brown eyes, brushed away her long curly hair, and kissed her. we'd both been wanting it for a long time. and it was amazing. we both sucked at kissing because it was both of our first times, but i loved it. and lucky for me, she loved it too. i miss those days– that was almost three years ago. we broke up last year."
2610,"i did that.
word of advice: don't do that"
2611,"good luck, all of you. high school is no joke– it could make or break you. i just graduated this past may."
2612,"boi i'm in college right now, took ap calculus last year, and i still count with my fingers"
2613,f
2614,"there are plenty of other fat people who wear glasses though. and this is something you can control– say, if you learn how to eat a proper diet and exercise (unless you have a disease). parents are something you would be much more self-conscious about, because anytime you want to bring someone home, you'd have to worry about it. for the rest of your life. this could really mess with a kid's mind"
2615,"be a productive successful member of society and not wallow in depression, junk food, porn, netflix"
2616,"they get bullied if their friends find out. if they make decent friends though, it would be fine. truth is though, most people aren't decent."
2617,"same. i had a girl for a couple years and it was heaven to just sit and cuddle, not worrying about talking, but then i fucked it up because of my stupid mental illness. 
you'll find someone soon. i managed to when i literally had no friends at the time."
2618,it already started this past monday
2619,this is what i imagine the area 51 raid to be like
2620,that's impossible on ps4 and xbox one
2621,why buy this when you can just do it yourself???
2622,"why is it different for the first time price of applying vs. the subsequent times at other schools? sorry, i'm still a noob here."
2623,oh shit. my dad would be 59 in 2022
2624,no night showers? wtf why?
2625,you ever been to the svatý kopeček basilica area? it's fantastic.
2626,oh jesus i thought you wrote nude beach at first
2627,i've had some nice taxi drivers. one driver in new mexico rushed us to a rental car agency because he knew it was close to closing time. really nice guy. didn't cheat us on the fare either.
2628,chem is hard as shit tho congrats on that!
2629,inspect element
2630,thank you— that eases my nerves a bit. i'm glad you got through it without too many problems. good luck to you too!
2631,"i'm taking gen chem i and biology at the same time in my first semester of freshman year. is this a bad idea? o_o
i've taken ap chem and bio in high school but didn't want to use the credit"
2632,"damn, how much did you study?"
2633,thank you-- i found what it is. a 1956 k-404!
2634,"the k-300 looks very similar, but i looked  up some pictures and it's slightly different. now i have a general idea though. thank you so much!"
2635,"this watch was given to me but i have no idea its value or time period. it looks to be quite old, as it is a pretty small men's watch. the back has inscribed hamilton on the left side and 10k gold filled with a box that says s&w on the right."
2636,"i was thinking it could be on purpose... it's a wood play button, and op wrote aselmble"
2637,wait a minute old english is a completely different language. do you mean middle english?

also, what is ap eng 3"
2640,"thank you so much, that comment made my day! people who spread love like you are amazing :)"
2641,"wow, really, what are the odds? 🤣 how is everything?"
2642,"my spanish teacher last year said ""me lo, te lo, se lo, j lo"", because you can't le lo with j lo. (lay low with jennifer lopez) 

it helps me remember that with indirect object pronouns, le lo doesn't exist"
2643,"columbus state university- there's a community college also called columbus state, my bad lol.
also it helped with scholarship apps"
2644,"yeah, i thought about majoring in neuroscience there, but decided it wasn't a good idea considering the stories of people having no life outside of study and stress"
2645,"you should be proud, that's awesome! i got a 90 my freshman year in one class, so that was very very close.. i just narrowly made it. (partners didn't pull through on a major group project so we all failed)
i know engineering is notoriously difficult in college, so that's really impressive.. idk if i could do it. my favorite class in hs was ap psychology, which is why i chose to major in psych. that subject isn't known to be super tough, but i'll experience some of the stress you feel with my med school prerequisites. good luck to you too and keep up the good work!"
2646,gpa summary includes nonacademic classes like physical education or fine arts. i mainly took a lot of music classes
2647,"just a small school nearby, columbus state. i considered uga or ga tech but figured they weren't for me based on my future goals"
2648,"mostly just bouts of depression hahahaaaaa

looking at you calc and chem"
2649,oof.. well i'm trying to go into medicine so i'm gonna keep it as high as i reasonably can without grinding 24/7 and having mental breakdowns lol
2650,honors courses at my school are also weighted 0.5 points while ap courses are weighted 1 point
2651,yeah that's what i did
2652,"thanks, you too!"
2653,"i took 8 exams, and most of them were covered by the school district and the state, so not really all that much"
2654,"last year when i took the ap spanish exam there was a power outage, and i finished later when the power came back on. scores weren't cancelled, it just said ""interruption reported"" underneath my ap score. didn't affect anything. maybe that'll give you some peace of mind lol"
2655,rolle's theorem is part of mvt tho
2656,"wait was this in calc ab
because wtf is squeeze theorem"
2657,optimization makes me want to kill myself

2659,"i live in georgia, and so have gotten 100% tuition paid (not including fees) and a little extra from merit scholarships, but not all costs in full. you think it's still worth it? it's just my parents didn't want to do the fafsa and i'm not sure how to explain why i should."
2660,"hey. my parents make more than 500k per year, but less than 600k. should i even bother doing a fafsa? i'm a senior in high school but i assumed there would be no point as i'm going to a public university and i thought i wouldn't get any aid– is that correct? my parents both worked very hard to get where they are and had very poor childhoods in less developed countries, so i want to take as little money as i can from them."
2661,scheiße
2662,i barely speak spanish. i took it last year... it was hard as all heck but i managed to pull off a 4. the computer/ speaking section is also awkward af lol
2663,"they corrected to 2,000"
2664,didn't that get shut down a few months ago?
2665,would you say gen chem i is a lot harder than ap chemistry? i took it in high school last year (i'm now a senior nearly graduating) and found it manageable
2666,oof $70 for a pack of 12 for me (including shipping)
2667,i second this
2668,camera fits perfectly in the second i! nice job :)
2669,"wow, this is awesome!"
2670,"it says ""or a citizen of the united states""? implying any citizen can run?"
2671,same here!
2672,this was on auto. i haven't tried manual camera settings yet
2673,"oh, really? thanks for the info, i didn't know that!"
2674,natural light does wonders! that's all there was to it
2675,"sure lmao just gotta watch out, he's still a pup so he snaps a little! "
2676,you should try changing the aspect ratio. it makes it full screen that way!
2677,"oh, alright, thanks! i haven't thought of that"
2678,"i took ap chem, made a 3, and don't remember a single thing. probably should have studied"
2679,"how is the sound quality in yours? i've never had ""truly wireless"" earbuds before, so i expected them to sound much like wired ones. for me personally they sound kind of bad though... is that just me?"
2680,weird. mine did
2681,that same thing is happening to me! i don't know what's up with it. maybe the screen protector?
2682,i just got my verizon s10! i've been waiting 5 freakn years to upgrade
2683,"yeah, i'm happy to finally upgrade from an s5! it might be coming early because i was able to preorder early, on february 20 thanks to my reservation."
2684,"yes, georgia"
2685,my verizon s10 is scheduled for delivery on wednesday!
2686,my verizon standard s10 has shipped from samsung.com. i ordered february 20
2687,i got to see and use the three models side by side and they all felt fantastic :)
2688,"why, what's wrong with the curved screens? i'm upgrading from the s5 to the s10, so the curved screen will be a first for me."
2689,"it has two cameras, so yeah, it's the 10e"
2690,"oh, really? did you use chat or phone? because the people i talked to in chat seemed kind of.. incompetent lol"
2691,"yeah you fucked up. and i did the same thing. i contacted support and there's no way to get the $50 unless you cancel and reorder the phone, but then you get it much later oof"
2692,you're czech? i've also visited some czech relatives that i barely know because they live 5000 miles away lol
2693,april 2? holy crap that's a long wait
2694,"damn, i ordered a verizon s10 on feb 20 from samsung.com, and it still says ship by march 8"
2695,"well, gestures are a thing now on the s10 as i've seen in some reviews"
2696,same here in the milky way galaxy
2697,"around 10:30-11 pm, didn't get the email till then"
2698,"i ordered on february 20, a day early because i reserved the phone, but i still have the button on my verizon s10"
2699,i feel you. i'm still stuck here on my s5 awaiting the s10
2700,this is why i love samsung!
2701,"if this is true, i'm happy too!"
2702,"looks like it doesn't matter now anyway, the code doesn't work"
2703,"[your name], your reservation awaits, and a lot more where that came from...
^that's the subject of the email, and it has a promo code for me saying ""if you had difficulty with redeeming the $50 credit"" use the code"
2704,oop nvm yeah i did find a promo code in my email just now.
2705,"i did the same thing, but the person i talked to in support said it would take about 5 business days to get a response. might've been talking out of his ass though, idk."
2706,shit like this actually happen in college? i start undergrad in august.
2707,"i actually never replaced it. i do have to charge it sometimes halfway through the day depending on how much i use it, but it has lasted me for the entire lifespan of the phone. at least 3-4 hours screen-on time on one charge, but i keep the screen dim."
2708,s5. finally getting a new phone
2709,the time limit to get the extra $50 in accessories is 72 hours
2710,"yeah oof, fortunately it has worked well through the years albeit very laggy. it has been my first and only cell phone since i was 13 when i got it"
2711,"it works through the email, but i like a dumbass skipped the accessories thinking i could claim them later"
2712,i had this exact same problem! i thought you could use the credit after ordering the phone. apparently not. let me know how it goes!
2713,"no, i had this problem. the accessory credit only applied yesterday, february 20."
2714,"ah ok, thanks! i'll go see if it's in-store later on, probably tomorrow or friday. trying to upgrade from the s5"
2715,how do you know this?
2716,we're doing integral apps now.. i guess my teacher just never taught us the squeeze theorem during the limits unit
2717,is this bc? i didn't learn this in ab.
2718,notification bar with messenger and text notifications? can't relate
2719,i'm an accepted future freshman considering cognitive science for pre-med; how have your classes been treating you?
2720,"right, i see. that makes me feel better, thanks!"
2721,"oh ok, thank you, that's very helpful! so that 4776 is per semester-- that makes it much more manageable."
2722,"the uga website lists ""typical residence hall"" separately-- $6042. that's why i'm wondering what is causing the disparity between zell's $4776 payout and uga's listing of $11830 for tuition and fees."
2723,"of course, dogs are more important than girls and sex!"
2724,"yeah, i'm graduating high school may 2019. born near the end of 2000."
2725,"thank you, that's very helpful!"
2726,people do not want to believe their precious porn habit is harmful.
2727,"yeah, i don't know what's going on with this year's heightened competitiveness. thanks!"
2728,the average person at my school has a high sat and 8-10 ap classes.. but i do have a higher gpa at least than most. thanks though!
2729,i saw- they received 2000 more applications for early decision alone this year than previous years. oof
2730,"thank you, that's very useful! i thought i would need more time for volunteering in hospitals and other such activities. based on everyone's input, i think uga is for me. here's to hoping i get in with regular decision!"
2731,"yeah, i know it is, but i figured there'd be at least some chance of my acceptance, since i was a leader in the musical scene of my city. i am 50% latino (father from colombia, mother from europe) so idk if that counts"
2732,"no, unfortunately i was still deciding what to do in the future-- i had the opportunity of continuing my education in the czech republic since my family is from there and i speak the language. but i decided too late i wanted to stay in the u.s. oof"
2733,"all right, awesome! thank you for taking the time for such a thoughtful reply! i'm just not applying to private schools because i'm hoping the zell miller scholarship will pay for most of the fees, and not leave me in crippling student debt lol.. i don't qualify for any need-based aid and parents don't want to pay much so that leaves me in a weird situation. 
uga sounds like it would be the best choice, though i don't know anyone there. i hope i get in! thanks for the advice."
2734,"i see. thank you, i've been considering everyone's comments. thank you for taking the time to inform me of your thoughts!"
2735,"all right, that's what i was thinking-- maybe don't overstrain myself if i'm eventually gonna need to study for mcat and stress about med school apps. thanks for the info!"
2736,"all right, thanks! i appreciate the feedback"
2737,"columbus state, already been accepted fortunately"
2738,"haha his name is ass and butt

edit: thanks, my most popular comment is now a butt joke! life goals right here"
2739,yeah.. they got to me when i was young and foolish. i am ashamed
2740,oh baby
2741,i as well
2742,"aw crap. i forgot how to do that, learned that like a year ago"

2749,my ps3 says cech-3001a. so i guess that wouldn't work?
2750,"why are people downvoting? that was really useful, thanks!"
2751,"i have home installed on my ps3 slim, but it's not jailbroken. idk if it's possible to jailbreak with the firmware it's on, since i haven't updated it in like 6 months maybe"
2752,"and only up to $171, at that, so likely even less!"

2770,i think most people would say semen retention.  it supposedly provides some benefits for men due to not having energy lost in the form of wasted semen
2771,"thank you, i'll try this! i think the staying offline may help the most. that way, there'd be more productivity rather than wasting time on the internet."
2772,"thanks man! don't give up, like i did.. i regret it now, might've made a better life for myself xd"
2773,triggered
2774,"hey, you're lucky-- you don't seem to be extremely addicted. for some, it's ""hard"" to be fapstinent for even one day. keep at it! soon you'll be in control of your life again."

3636,they are both bangers
3637,i have completed my assignment mom
3638,then why say reposts are toxic it's just hypocrisy
3639,literally a repost
3640,nah not insensitive.
3641,smile or you dont get the chiken nuggies
3642,no i dont i dont love my mom i despise her. the thought of her makes me angry. i want to punch myself in the face when i think of her because she is such a shit human
3643,i have been backstabbed
3644,it is your fault you love someone tho. ik its really really hard to stop but you can do it. example my mother is a horrible person and i hate the fact i have lived with her long enough to realize she was a crazy asshole. it was hard but i detached myself from her. i've lived with her my whole life and i believed everything she said for a long time. until i grew enough self respect to stop relying on her.
3645,i dont think this is normal i think this attachment you have to him is not healthy for you. he is in a relationship and hit you.
3646,ye it's a vibe
3647,i have to disagree if you love someone no matter how they hurt you its 100% you fault for staying with them
3648,it's me even though i'm a dude into it ;)
3649,thankyouverymuch
3650,two numba nines with a numba nine large
3651,what did the sky do to you?
3652,i still believe it isnt their business. you can comfort them and all that but i dont think you should even interact with the person who cheated. it's kinda immature to mob mentality onto a dude like that. even if they are a shit head. example if your dad called you and ass and you got hurt feelings you wouldn't call your boyfriend to beat him up or anything (that's an example prolly wouldn't react as bad by just being called an ass).
3653,i think there are too many precautions to prevent us from going into depression. i believe at worst a recession might happen
3654,aight i am appeased
3655,why are you friends with shit people?
3656,aight but violence isnt really an answer
3657,why do you need to be specific? what does it add?
3658,its implied that straight people dont know their stuff and wouldn't peer pressure you into doing that
3659,why did you add they are straight it shouldn't mean anything to the example
3660,you are generalizing straight people and that is not okiedokie. because generalizing people is dumb
3661,candy wrappers by summer salt
3662,nothing it's not your business
3663,i wish bro

3983,"i believe your cynicism is better than your lack of care. and sure i agree posting about crushes and for karma is dumb but people are people and they do what they want when they want you not caring isnt gonna change that even if you want to or not. from my experience people, my self included, think that funny > not caring. because there is no engagement in that"
3984,if everything you type is random then what's with the person you portray. wouldn't you try to be funnier? because not caring isnt very random
3985,"idk i overthink and analyze too many things but i dont believe that i ended a conversation once. and there were many times that we just were typing random stuff to be the last to type. i'm dumb but i'm not stupid, well i'm a lil stupid"
3986,yi is pretty useless early so all you gatta do if you got lane pressure is go into the jg with your jg and kill him and take all his farm
3987,"sad people aren't only sad. unless they bathe in self pity, which is stupid. they can still be funny and make banter. people who are kin to dirty carpets are just boring to talk to. you are insanely stubborn and it makes no sense to be stubborn when you portray yourself not to care. an example is that you never let me respond last, and i dont like doing that either. i dont know what i'm saying anymore."
3988,good
3989,so do people that have the opinion of a dirty carpet
3990,is there something wrong with being sad?
3991,i am very random = funny no?
3992,"for now, but then i'll be annoying another time"

3995,didn't ask
3996,didn't ask if you didn't ask

3998,cant relate
3999,that's so passive aggressive lmao

5042,seems like she was the problem. if anything i'd say just fight the prime cuts if you know what i mean.
5043,nobody. reddit's whole thing is semi-anonymity. you have a name but that's about it. people don't really use reddit as a social media platform for individuals.
5044,"now here's a better question, do you really think you're reaching out to the right audience? most guys on reddit are awkward as fuck and seem to have self confidence issues all the time. do you really think they are the ones sending them?"
5045,"better question is, what's the point of any post on this sub"

5058,honestly the kinda light hearted arguments/debates are really fun and memorable. but that might just be me though
5059,"i think sometimes it's the willingness to disagree. if a girl (or hell, anybody in general) isn't just backing up everything i say and having differing opinions and talking about them really makes them stand out. it makes them seem more independent and therefore stick out."
5061,"power wise, yes. but can it steal fucking anything from you???"

5108,"for me i did it very frequently when i was around that age. but after a while it starts to become less exciting and it becomes less frequent. it's very normal for a teenager to masturbate frequently. it's actually somewhat therapeutic in a way. it relieves stress and makes you more focused. i wouldn't worry about it.

5906,"don't worry. i've already called him and sometime between now and next week, a lightning bolt will strike you, or your house, and you will burn to cinders..."

5911,"i know there was a cool looking mask, and a steelbook case i think it was. i know there's more than that but i don't remember what else there was.

and i'd recommend watching jojo's bizarre adventures at some point. there are some weird scenes but it's pretty funny, plus there's all the memes associated with it."
5912,"yeah, i did. unfortunately i missed out on some physical copy exclusive stuff though. but i'll survive.

it really is a game unlike no other game imo. yet, it's similar to my favourite anime show, jojo's bizarre adventures which you may have heard of/watched."
5913,"i pre-ordered it digitally, so i knew i was going to get it today at least. i feel bad for others who have to wait a couple weeks though for the physical copies.

5927,"i haven't played warframe in like a year or two now, but i know they still have a reputation of being one of the nicest community about.

if you were invested in the game, you know that wyrm prime was vaulted. a guy spent like 300-400 plat i think just to buy it for newbie me."
5928,"well actually it's at midnight today it comes out, but still basically tomorrow.

it's persona 5 royal. i see all these posts about doom eternal, and animal crossing new horizons, but none for the new persona game.

i dropped £85 for it. i just know they're going to do a good job. persona 5 was one of my favourite games after all."
5929,"ah, fair enough lol."
5930,a band which centres around eyes. that sounds kinda creepy and concerning without context lol.

5935,"as of lately, same tbh lol.

although i should accept the fact it'll never happen lol."
5936,tgfbros or braddoesbanter in my opinion are the best youtubers because they actually make me laugh on a constant basis.
5937,"but you can't say no.

(jk, don't do it if you want to it's fine.)"
5938,"anime, youtube and gaming. tomorrow a new game is coming out and i'm hyped as fuck for it."
5939,"71. answer all questions from 1, to 67 lol."
5940,sounds like the perfect game. no flaws at all.
5941,thank you my good sir.
5942,it sounds like a blessing to me.
5943,it's a great name if i do say so myself.
5944,is that danganronpa?
5945,even when there's an event too. sometimes the event music is abhorrent and i'd want to change it.
5946,"yeah. it's 600ms i'm pretty sure, so it's guaranteed."
5947,the top heavy is guaranteed after heavy parry for aramusha.
5948,*not when you get heavy parried*
5949,*cent and aramusha looms over you*
5950,"don't know.

but that berserker looks to be partaking in wholesome family fun."
5951,"i wondered that when i pre-ordered the game. the answer i believe is that the uk can refund preorders, but other countries like the us can't. so if i refunded i'd still have the theme (i think.) it's something like that at least."
5952,can't blame him tbh.
5953,"oh. even in the pre-order section?

and i'm guessing you searched the game up already?

i'm not sure what else there is unless you make a new account based in a different country to where you live and buy it on that?"
5954,"the game still has a couple days till it comes out. i was just able to preinstall it. that's all.

(i didn't exactly understand your question, so if i answered with something completely different, i'm sorry.)"
5955,"ding ding ding.

you're right my friend."
5956,"if you're on about the dynamic theme, i sadly can't. i have to wait until the day p5r comes out. and i don't know any way i could screen record my ps4 anyways to do it."
5957,"hmm... if i told you that this voice in my head wants the traitors from passione dead, would that help?"
5958,"ah. well, i hope you have a nice day."
5959,"no. it's when girls are bitten by mosquitoes or something, and their legs or arms turn red a bit and they swell. that's what turns him on.

oh, and i hope we're able to. he's eluded us for a while now. i heard he raped a 14 year old too... how sick..."
5960,boku no pico.
5961,"i have a friend who gets turned on by bug bites.

we're gonna kill the president so brb."
5962,"so there's a voice in my head... he told me to kill this cripple from france? we're currently in italy and i'm guiding this blind and deaf guy to the colosseum. the cripple is near me, question is should i obey him?

he wants an arrow or something. it's very weird..."
5963,"i have a hands fetish. i usually go into people's houses and blow them up, just to obtain their soft, supple hands... i did that recently and went to st. gentleman's and let my girlfriend decided what sandwich she wanted. we had a nice romantic date until some little snot nosed punk stole my girlfriend and her sandwich... i followed him to school and blew him up. i just want to live a quiet life for goodness sakes..."
5964,yeah. i don't think any boss from assassin's creed comes close to being as hard as them imo. (from the ones i've played at least)
5965,yeah. especially the two on the top right of the map. that was the hardest fight of my early ps4 gaming career lol.
5966,exactly. i loved the legendary ship battles on ac black flag. they were difficult but so so fun.
5967,"nah. i never used stealth in any ac game unless it was mandatory. (like a certain mission on ac bf) i enjoyed breaking into forts and stuff and doing all i could to survive with the cool abilities and stuff.

also, the ships and all that are cool though. i don't care if it's reused content. ship battles are so fun, and that's why odyssey and black flag are my favourite assassin's creeds."
5968,nah nah nah. it was set in ancient greece and had boats. nothing is beating that imo.
5969,if it's as good as ac odyssey they can take my money at some point lol. but that will be hard to accomplish.
5970,nah. i don't want to be kicked by its back legs.
5971,"do random shit, like idk purge repugnant sinners."
5972,it's related to the april fools event i'm pretty sure.
5973,good. it's a sin. i know god personally. he sentences you to a life of eternal suffering for doing such a sin.
5974,"you know what is actually a sin?

littering. god ensures eternal torture for those who litter."
5975,hi gay i'm mom
5976,"already watching others so i can't, sorry."
5977,its because hes gay isnt it you fucking homophobe ! ! !
5978,"i'll keep that in mind for later...

wait what, who said that?"
5979,"here's the solution:

step 1: assault

step 2: tactical retreat"
5980,i wish i could. but i'll resort to permanent solutions later on in life.
5982,"nope.

it's golden experience requiem"
5983,"kore ga requiem, da..."
5984,"nah. i'll give you a hint.

5986,only song i've listened to was the one called beast in black. it's pretty decent.
5987,"i like it because it's a unique fighting game. you get used to this stuff. well, i know i did for the most part. i still have my days when i get light spammed to death lol."
5988,"yeah, i do. but i'm not really wanting to play any far cry game though.

i'm playing through some other games for the plat trophies."
5989,"the more you know i guess.

i don't know why i wouldn't remember that but i do have a shitty memory lol."
5990,"i don't remember it being multiplayer from when i played it.

must've slipped my mind lol."
5991,"yeah i wanna fuck.

find

ur

crispy

kremes"
5992,that's multiplayer? since when lol.
5993,"yeah i wanna fuck.

find

ur

crispy

kremes"
5994,if you's got it for ps+ maybe try for honor. it has a steep learning curve but it's pretty fun imo. i've played about 1500 hours of it lol.
5995,"i'm playing gta vice city to try get the plat. same with rdr2.

i'm going to be playing san andreas after vice city though."
5996,"not to be that guy, but you spelt arrows wrong.

unless it's part of the joke or something. feel free to r/whooosh me lol."
5997,"yeah. i think you had to manually turn it, and it was slooooow as hell if memory serves."
5998,there was even a point where i was basically getting demolished over and over again in the corner with his telekinesis with no way to escape. like literally none... when i eventually beat him i was so happy.
5999,"i don't remember what you're on about at all there, sorry lol.

my fondest memory was the telekinesis fucking me about against silver lol."
6000,you better be watching quality anime like boku no pico.
6001,"i can't even find one good thing to say about the game really, and i basically completed the game too iirc. all i remember is the silver fight, the first level, and a bit of another level."
6002,"oh no. i remember that game... i don't know how you could get through it.

should i feel bad that you had to go through it, or happy that you got through it?"
6003,"platinum or heart gold.

i haven't even beat red on hg. i even have an imported team from platinum lol."
6004,"but, what if he is?"
6005,i don't even need to click on the link to know that's eromanga sensei lol.
6006,male shaman.
6007,"ah. by the way you worded it it sounded like you never knew.

oh well, no worries."
6008,"if you want to save some money on salt, play jormungandr.

backdodge to win."
6009,i don't think he could as he was getting pulled towards the ladder when he tried to get in range.
6010,next somehow he'll be flipping shinobi ranged gb.
6011,nope. only for the hero you purchased it on.
6012,warden. don't know how people can tolerate his playstyle.
6013,and champion status/embossings.
6014,"abunai sisters: koko and mika.

best totally 2d animated cartoon."
6015,"no.

but i do remember 1 guy 1 screwdriver."
6016,you can close application and not get that short ban.
6017,"brand new

bed town"
6018,"i don't care if this sounds scummy but i'll say it anyways.

i agree. for the sole reason that i'd be able to refuse revives on people who purposefully kill me for revives."
6019,"when i first saw a hammer i thought i wouldn't like jormungandr, in fact i thought he would be my least favourite out of the year 3 heroes. but he turned out to be my second main. i loved him from the moment i played him.

ironically enough, black prior, who i was most excited for, turned out to probably be my least favourite year 3 hero."
6020,exactly lol. i swear i've survived what felt like weeks with him. his feats and perks are so good. there are no bad ones. (except probably centurions march from what i remember)
6021,yeah. he's not even a good character. but his entire character is so fun it's worth it.
6022,jormungandr without a doubt.
6023,"that taste... that's the distinct tang of a liar, u/garfieldgauntlet..."
6024,true.
6025,absolutely nothing.
6026,definetly eel soup.
6027,an old banger that is.
6028,"the knuckles and skin on your hand are so soft. you have such cute, white fingers. will you rub my cheek? rubbing my cheek calms me down so much. when i was a child, you've heard of leonardo da vinci's mona lisa, right? when i saw that painting in an art book, when i first saw that, i don't know how to put it, um this is a bit dirty, but i got a boner. i just cut out the part with her hands and hung it in my room for a while. i want to cut off yours, too. my name is yoshikage kira. i've killed 48 women with beautiful hands up to now. you're the only one! you're the only one who will know my identity!"
6029,"west of mt. ignis, born and raised

i light parried the weeb and pk got scared

6030,"if i were 18, sure."
6031,couldn't you try to video call him or something?
6032,"or at least buff assassin's to give them a reason to have it. idk.

i'd prefer if they were gone too though."
6033,"ah. that happened to me too. i even spent 20 something minutes in a ranked duel and won and just got a single symbol. the next day it would repeat.

i think the more you play/unlock, the less chance you have of receiving things that day."
6034,"time in a ranked game is the only factor in increasing ranked ornament chances.

oh, and you have to win the match."
6035,"for events, the daily orders are harder for some stupid reason..."
6036,"it's why for duel orders i always play hl or shugo.

they may react to everything. but you can abuse that to your advantage with these characters."
6037,"level 3 bots don't read your inputs. they like react to everything. even a delayed berserker heavy feint light.

not fun..."
6038,for honor... yikes... i'm fucked.
6039,yo angelo.🗿
6040,you have more levels in nuxia than aramusha. that's a sin. you must get aramusha to level 7. it's a known fact slag nuxia needs to be the lowest level on the roster.
6041,"it's never been a thing i don't think. and i really want it to be a thing... seeming as how rare xp fest's are, i doubt we'll see a steel fest anytime soon."
6042,"speed revive

smoke bomb

sharpened blade/second wind

fire trap

these are what is use at least for when i play her which is never."
6043,definetly jorm.
6044,that was before his rework.
6045,so it's the same type of stand as star platinum...
6046,lol that makes sense to me. i thought it was a clan or something.
6047,"i wasn't responding to you, but the other guy but ok.

i'm only responding to you now as you're responding to me."
6048,"lol how am i meant to know. you never stated it anywhere.

no need to be a cunt."
6049,i fear if it turns out to be 99 rounds...
6050,yeah no. i would pay to keep single pick out of for honor.
6051,i'd rather warden be nerfed first please.
6052,"this is meant to be a joke?

it's obviously fact."
6053,that happened to me i think. i had to uninstall the game then reinstall it.
6054,i don't remember exactly. it's near the end of this month. i believe it's on the roadmap though
6055,"i would tell you, but i'm blinded now because of you...

^^^devious ^^^sinner..."
6056,an oil tanker for you...
6057,"i'm frequently in a party by myself so i don't see it as a problem really.

and it doesn't take too long to make one, like 5 seconds at most."
6058,if you're on ps4/xbox (i think it works for xbox) just start a party. you don't even need to mute them.
6059,i'm sorry but who uses auto revive on jorm when you have ragnarok!!! engin miskuun
6060,"heavy parry - double lights, or the parry light 

light parry - heavy into confirmed light

gb - heavy into confirmed light

wallsplats are useless. it's the same as gb

oos throw - light, heavy into confirmed light

oos parry - the same as the throw i believe"
6061,shaman definetly.
6062,"i don't care about the heavy hyper armour, but the lights... definitely not."
6063,"there's also certain exclusive things you get with certain dlc.

some include:

an effect

champion status

scavenger crates (i think)

and i believe xp boots.

just letting op know."
6064,100%.
6065,hunting devious sinners...
6066,it doesn't matter the direction.
6067,"they could do so much, and have so much variety with this. only if ubi... only if..."
6068,"one with the instruments or something where he tosses it to the enemy, they play it very poorly, then your character shakes their head, walks up, takes the instrument and bashes them over the head with it."
6069,not a bad idea tbh. but you'd have to have the emote equipped i'm guessing to use the execution?
6070,the dagger is nice. hate the hatchet though.
6071,"it's zone into heavy from any side.

or light into heavy if you don't have the stamina."
6072,"eh, the extra steel is always nice though tbh."
6073,"i know it's claimed already, but i just want to say you're a very kind person for giving that code away."
6074,nope lol. i only played like one game of the testing grounds.
6075,"not for opinions, no. if you're being a cunt, or are wrong about something, sure."
6076,downvoted for an opinion. the reddit way...
6077,"seeming as we've been waiting for cent rework since like september of last year, we're probably going to have to like the end of this year/next for it lol."
6078,"dodge/parry orange

block red.

that's all really tbh.

all his bashes are reactable and you can't feint the heavy when it goes unblockable. don't try to parry the variable timed heavies unless you're confident you can read/parry it.

lights are slow too, with the slashing animation. so if you pay attention to animations lights = slashes, heavies = stabs.

he can follow up a whiffed kick with a heavy, so don't always try to gb the kick as you may be punished for it. don't try to always parry the heavy after it either as he can charge it and soft feint gb to punish you."
6079,"i hadn't thought of that. please ubi, wu lin faction. please."
6080,paddle your own canoe. female glad only.
6081,"huh. there was a first? the more you know lol. i'm not really that big of a fan of first person shooters, but i loved the concept as i've said already. that enough sold me to get the game. the sequel was kinda short from what i remember too."
6082,"oh god, homefront revolution... it's such a great concept. i loved the concept of north korea taking over the world but the game was in my opinion really poorly executed. it's not the worst game out there. if you like first person shooters, you might like it. but i didn't like it at all."
6083,round it up like a normal person and you have the blessed number.
6085,"i was close enough. i've heard some younger people were killed, but i'm not sure if they had any negative medical conditions. op probably is healthy so i reckon they will be fine too."
6086,i don't know why the media is making such a big deal out of it. it has like a 3% mortality rate...
6087,shaman or jorm. they're my mains and you can be really offensive with both. they're great fun.
6088,"don't know why we're getting downvoted though lol. all the people who don't have good taste must be doing it lol. 

/s"
6089,"there's always time to repent for your actions.

but seeming as it's your cake day, i may make an exception depending upon the severity of it..."
6090,you're not a sinner though.
6091,that is a beautiful specimen if i do say so myself.
6092,i want to fuck. fuck up a sinners day.
6093,it is indeed.
6094,fair enough. i apologize.
6095,if you're in the mood he says. you better be in the mood.
6096,"ok. so be gay to everyone, including you?"
6097,don't let oingo see this. it'll give him ptsd.
6098,"being gay is quite a lot of effort. too much effort actually.

(idk what i'm saying lol.)"
6099,"yeah. like who doesn't carry a game console, a tv, and an active internet connection with them at all times? like smh..."
6100,exactly. that's the way to do it.
6101,use it on playstation or xbox. that's how.
6102,"right. as a disciple of christ, scantly clad women are a no go. the sinning wench. where do you reside? i'll be there in a jiffy to force her to repent."
6103,french.
6104,a single cookie.
6105,don't blame them. god covid-19 is so fucking sexy. you don't know how fucking bad i want it inside me.
6106,because k.d matters in fortnite. if you can't built fort knox in 0.2 seconds you're not my type.
6107,so that makes you a big titty anime boy huh?
6108,i don't think the mods will be too happy about this post.
6109,i'm born on a 22nd and i'll also show this punk cool with you.
6110,still too much effort.
6111,"arrivederci, monsieur."
6112,the beast in black.
6113,"oh, also. i believe persona 5 is on a deal as we speak, but persona 5 royal is a better version of persons 5, so you might want to wait.

just letting you know if you never knew."
6114,definitely persona 5 (or persona 5 royal when it comes out at the end of this month.) or red dead redemption 2.
6115,sinner... god has no space in heaven for your kind. he is disgusted.
6116,it's definetly not the best music genre. my opinion.
6117,"fine, as per the norm."
6118,"sometime this year he is, yes."
6119,"personally i'd say shaman, cent or glad."
6120,good. a 50 odd damage crushing counter that links into his 50/50 is very balanced.
6121,i like how everyone's heard this song. yet i'm the odd one out lol. kinda ironic.
6122,only in scotland. but not the latter.
6123,guys too lol. what you on about?
6124,yeah. it's pretty good. i liked the new armour more though.
6125,"to be fair. i don't know much about r6s. i don't even remember half the roster, and i don't remember what any of them do. i only played for a few hours.

but it's still annoying when i can't play a character i want to play. oh, and the defender/attacker thing is just an add on to that in r6s but it's a core thing of the game, i know that. i just used r6s as a comparison as they're by the same company.

if for honor got single pick i would not nearly have as much fun. they should just dedicate gamemodes for it."
6126,"personally i don't think he looks that bad. there's definitely characters with worse fashion.

^^^nuxia"
6127,it's also severely frustrating going against 4 centurions but it's still here.
6128,level 3 black prior though...
6129,"well, that's just what people are saying. i personally hope it's a hero leak."
6130,"they could've just done what they did with for honor

ranked = single pick

regular play = anything

i hate being restricted as to what character i play. it's fucking stupid."
6131,"as am i...

i've committed a horrendous deed, please forgive me father. i am but a small a d disgusting weed in your beautiful garden."
6132,experimental area is probably just what testing grounds is but translated from another language.
6133,apparently it's some prince of persia event. i just want it to be a new hero. i don't want to grind for ages when i'm kinda bored of the game as is tbh.
6134,playing as the same hero as your other friends/ransoms is one of the most fun things in dominion though. it's one of the reasons rainbow 6 seige got boring to me.
6135,"wow... just wow... imagine, just imagine man. oh my fucking god like really?! oh wow... fuck sakes man...

jk love you really."
6136,are you fighting gold?
6137,"it's a free chance for ornaments, so i see no complaints lol"
6138,yeah. i knew it was a joke.
6139,"you can buy it on another account and set that to your ""primary ps4"""
6140,it's over 9000 elite outfit has you covered for part of it.
6141,"that is so offensive like wowza how dare you call jojo no kimyou na bouken gay. i think god wants a word, heretic.

jk love you really."
6142,indeed.
6143,shit
6144,"the sky.

(i know, i'm so funny.)"
6145,"i feel like i remember shaman and another character got different revive animations, and highlander got a new animation too i believe. i know i remember speaking to my friend about it though, so i know something changed."
6146,time to non supestes the heretic off the cliff.
6147,i know right...
6148,that's how it was for me. i got all the worst ornaments before getting the one i wanted. oh well. i wish you good luck man. you'll need it lol.
6149,"oh, also. i don't know if it was sheer luck or not, but i grinded for the ornaments between plat 5 and diamond 2 and got stuff much quicker than i was when i purposefully was dropping ranks to help a friend around plat 2. so rank might play an effect on drop rate, but i can't confirm it."
6150,you have to win to even get a chance of getting it. you have an increased chance based on time you spent in a match though.
6151,he got a nerf to the time it takes to go out of os when you go in. i don't remember the exact values though. i think it was 33ms to 300ms.
6152,funny valentine.
6153,my guess is that he's stuck in an infinite loading screen?
6154,"hate her. hate her emotes. hate her executions. only one decent signature. hate how she looks. oh, and i despise her voice. it's abhorrent."
6155,"yeah. he has a bit more health, and with static guard you're less prone to making mistakes.

then there's his feats, oh my god. his tier 3/4 feats combined make him a wall."
6156,"don't listen to them, nor listen to mainstream stuff, so i am the 5%"
6157,"i did read it, it was just by your comment it looked like you thought the entire show was only two hours long."
6158,"demon slayer has 24 episodes, and that's just the first season. not weak lol."
6159,like 20k something.
6160,tiandi maybe? has a bunch of dodge attacks and fast chain lights like orochi.
6161,"niceu niceu, very nice uve_v-chan."
6162,uses 3 freeze to pin her down.
6163,that's what i thought as well but isn't pk's bleed damage fine?
6164,"and shaman has a 31 damage 400/433ms (300/333ms indicator) soft feint lol.

shugoki has a 19 or 17 damage heavy finisher

highlander 24 damage heavy finishers

qi stance top light is 9 damage iirc too.

some of these numbers are fucked man..."
6165,"i like the stamina changes, but nothing else really."
6166,shaolin forehead kisses too.
6167,yup. because of it the emote has pretty nice emote spam. and the fact she sings makes fun and roses the best execution for glad. male gladiators are inferior lol.
6168,female glad. paddle your own canoe. fun and roses. nothing else needed to be said.
6169,i'm sure aomeone in the uk died recently of the coronavirus as well.
6170,"true. but it's a clear parody. if you ripped off the song completely sure, but you never. it's a shame though. you and all the others did a great job with it. :)"
6171,"now this is the true meaning of ""hope"" this season.

only if you were able to participate in that competition, this seems like a solid win lol."
6172,welp. looks like i'm dying by a girl named mariah via magnetism.
6173,"i only played it once for the steel incentive. i don't care for it anymore. that's probably what most people thought. i just looked at the changes in a custom match, it's easier that way for me anyways."
6174,well then...
6175,"i basically like it just because of how it looks. that's it really lol. oh, and the ballistas are kinda nice too."
6177,"the heavy parry punish can wallsplat, and that's where its power comes from. it is not balanced at all. i know just before i was talking about a prerequisite, but 35 damage for a heavy parry, that stuns, drains stamina ect. really? make it 24-26 somehow and i'll be ok with it. like the impale does 10 but only confirming a light on wallsplat.

and make the light parry punish 40 or 38 damage and i'll be ok with it. he is meant to have high parry punishes, but that's too high."
6178,"35 damage heavy parry punish which can wallsplat, stun, drain stamina and open up damage to teammates is not a balanced thing.

49 damage is too much too. unless a punish has prerequisites it needs to achieve, it should do no more than 40 damage.

then there's his unpublishable shove. make it punishable. that's all."
6179,14 damage heavies totally balanced.
6180,"36 damage zone from 50

opener heavy 28 from 27

i think her finisher heavys did 32, now they do 34 (i think.)

unblockable heavy does 35

dodge forward attacks do 18, except running attack which is 21

bite still does 50

side dodge heavies do 20 still.

lights do 15 still, or 16. i don't remember exactly.

i never tested the bleed damage amounts myself though.

so she hasn't really been affected, and any way she has, there has been a nice trade off in heavy damage buffs which isn't a complaint in my books. rip hl mains though. 24 and 26 damage heavies. 31 unblockable."
6181,"i feel the same way too. the only change i've noticed is the stamina one, and i wouldn't have noticed it without watching the warriors den."
6182,nobody is perfect.
6183,nah. personally i like sentinel.
6184,"imagine hating my two mains. :(

(jk hate who you're going to hate)"
6185,testing grounds is happing this week if you count that.
6186,probably the harp imo.
6187,"i personally just do it because it's fun to do. i've lost ranked games, dominion games ect because of it but who cares lol. especially when you hit an oos heavy. an absurd madlad highlander did that to me today. i have total respect for the guy.

but if conq's bp's cent's and all that try to do their 50/50 bash you can do a light and get away with it. it is a strategy in a sense."
6188,it would've been funnier if she hit her head tbh lol.
6189,get on all fours and bow to the god. may he be merciful...
6190,not for me lol.
6191,huh. always thought he had 90 health. i just looked there. you're right.
6192,"nah. i'm pretty sure it's 90. i can't test right now, but just go against a jorm bot and if he kills you in 2 or 3 hammer slams we'll know."
6193,"yeah. i hated that, or at least make him fall over, but make it be for a shorter time, so for example jorm doesn't get 50 damage for one mistake. and make it so most characters get a 500-600ms attack off.

oh, and buff health. 90 health, not good."
6194,"i agree. they should definetly try to improve on his ranged attacks as they're the unique thing about them, like maybe at the end of a chain he can throw one and it grabs you and he reels you in while attacking with the 2nd? sounds like his ranged gb now that i think about it... but it would be faster, like 600ms or something?"
6195,"yeah. that's one of the things i like about him, but they have to slowly strip everything away from him..."
6196,"i miss him before any of his nerfs. he was fun to play, now he's so boring to play..."
6197,personally i find bots way harder to fight. but that's because i constantly go against level 3 bots who react to everything and are not fun to fight at all.
6198,"dominion vs ai if you want the games to go quicker but get less steel/xp.

breach vs ai if you want the games to go longer but get more steel/xp.

this thing about ganking though, coordinated ganks for one can actually help you improve in the game. like knowing when to attack after certain attacks for example. but you probably don't want a debate lol sorry. i can't tell a person how to play.

you will probably get ganked by the bots though, just forewarning you about that."
6199,joseph joestar would love this change.
6200,"i shall not. you have my gratitude you very kind person. i shall use it wisely, accurately pinpointing and eliminating said nuxia. i shall have to pay you back some day."
6201,"ok, that's fine. i'll kill off a nuxia. i thank you for your forgiveness my friend. :)"
6202,yes please.
6203,"i'm sorry, but that thing there definetly is not cute.

i said sorry so i think i should be pardoned for anything and all."
6204,i throw heavies lol. sometimes it works and it's funny as hell.
6205,and here i am throwing oos attacks at rep 215 because why not lol.
6206,"i'd like to play characters i enjoy, so no thanks."
6207,"i remember getting hate mail from one of these honorable people. he said the fact i was apparently turtling with jorm was toxic and emote spamming for fun, key words there for fun was toxic. this was on dominion btw. if i wanted to be toxic i'd be spamming the chat lol. once he said he was one of those honorable people i literally stopped arguing with him. but then he spent about 10 minutes asking for my age, like that's a bit creepy. i just said i was like 4 or something over and over."
6208,better to not let the enemy get the satisfaction of killing you lol.
6209,"he loves you enough to hug you, even when on the battlefield. what a kind guy. :)"
6210,lol that must be what it looks like when i leave every ranked game to try help my friend.
6211,"she just doesn't sound normal though lol. 

that probably sounds racist but i don't care lol"
6212,i know right.
6213,"her voice annoys me, so if she gets buffed more people would use her, which i don't want."
6214,rather not see her reworked tbh. don't want to hear slag nuxia speak.
6215,thank you. don't know why people do take it seriously lol.
6216,"warden, or slag nuxia.

warden because of his very fun moveset with absolutely no flaws. a 50/50 which can be feinted while moving, does 40 damage even when oos. nothing wrong with 50/50's but his is the worst.

oh, and slag nuxia for her slag voicelines."
6217,it was a result of his charged heavy option select nerf.
6218,"one of my favourites.

fighting gold - coda"
6219,same here.
6220,good stuff this is. the world is such a nice place to live in.
6221,"bruno thiccarati.

you don't know how bad i want him to ari ari ari ari ari ari ari ari me."
6222,quite literally.
6223,euphoria please.
6224,left.
6225,true. :( one necc a day makes the forest loli go yay!
6226,nuxia has it too. it's funny. my two least favourite characters have thick blood and i'm a shaman main. i just realised that now.
6227,don't know how you could stand her voice for 10 reps. honestly.
6228,potayto potahto.
6229,i feel bad. you had to get 10 reps in nuxia...
6230,"he can charge up his heavies by holding r2 as you know. if he held the charge and they feinted the attack he'd still be charging the heavy but if the enemy went through with the attack he parried it. the nerf basically makes it so he takes longer to cancel the charge with anything, so the enemy can punish them with a gb. conq and hl also got this nerf."
6231,it's just the for honor menu music i believe
6232,"yeah. they nerfed his charged heavy option select recently, and as a result quad dash got taken away too."
6233,same.
6234,your only gay if you play shaman. wait a minute...
6235,every pedo ever is converging to your locale.
6236,least you got to hear some banging beats with near to no interruption.
6237,"here's a little tip. it's a known fact that if you want something related to rng in games, you'll never get it. so just play pk for fun. you don't want the armoyr set, you just like to play pk, riiiiiigghhhttt?"
6238,imagine teleporting across the map.
6239,i know. but it should be over. my friend is able to connect just fine.
6240,"my friend is able to play though, so the maintenance should have been finished."
6241,i don't have it on xbox. i have it on ps4. even then i don't like duels lol.
6242,i don't think she's cute lol.
6243,"i don't know why people find shaman cute lol. 

and i hate nuxia, and her voice annoys me. so that's why i said that."
6244,"i'm sorry, but nuxia and cute are not two words that should ever be put in a sentence together."
6245,ceasar-chan.
6246,"you can also do the choke into dashing top heavy soft feint to heavy, as long as there's a wall around."
6247,i do it sometimes. it's fucking satisfying to choke that cunt warden.
6248,"> cringe anime shit

lol no words."
6249,"huh, you're right. there was no nobushi. i never realised."
6250,"fair enough. we all have our opinions.

but imagine not agreeing that jorm and shaman are worthy of s tier smh i'm sad now i'm crying myself to sleep now."
6251,"practise and you'll get it man. :) go against a bot and try practising dodging in time, once you have that down, try against players. it will be a bit harder because it's an actual player but you'll definetly get there. :)"
6252,15 damage toe stab is all you need to make glad fun lol.
6253,sorry. :( there's just something i don't like about either of them.
6254,indeed. the 50 damage + healing double wombo combo gang.
6255,"i mostly play dominion, so i can actually hit people with cent in ganks and stuff.

oh, and slag nuxia because of her voice. it pisses me off."
6256,"i like the sound of his axe hitting of the opponent. (totally not a psychopath, i know) and to me, when someone was being a toxic cunt on the opposite team, i pick hito and do the dreaded 33/33/33 and it's fun to just piss them off with him, that's what i find fun with him, being able to piss off the enemy lol."
6257,you've got to dodge it really late. it dodges feint into bash too.
6258,it was interesting. i'll give it that.
6259,"you can backdodge on orange, just saying if you never knew. jorm is my second main and i hate it when people do that lol"
6260,i don't know what i watched...
6261,pulsatingshaft
6262,probably sadly.
6263,"so the ornament, got you."
6264,"the ornament, or helmet?"
6265,yikes.
6266,aye. it's a rule that if you are subbed to r/forhonor you should be banned.
6267,"ah, ok. it's fine."
6268,shaman in c tier. i'm depressed now.
6269,"shaman doesn't get a bite after heavy parry, you can still dodge it."
6270,i'll make sure to play orochi for you.
6271,same. i'm glad i got my hero's weapons too. but i'm glad i got the executions more as they're actually pretty decent.
6272,"i think this battle pass is just fine in the terms of grinding. it's completely feasible for those who play on a semi regular basis. but they should've got rid of salvage and increase steel gains. i hope they learn something from this.

oh, and the grind for me extends to all the exclusive event gear. i don't want the armours because i know if i try to get them i won't lol."
6273,that's depressing.
6274,but i am a prophet of the lord. does he not look over me and shine divine fortune upon me?
6275,he did not. i got bullied repeatedly in ranked.
6276,"i don't regret it either, but the salvage was so depressing to get."
6277,ranked duels lol.
6278,nah. warden is a hated character lol.
6279,ah i see. yeah. that would be nice.
6280,i never intended to get tier 100 any time soon anyways. i only got here that quick because of ranked duel farming for ornaments.
6281,or gave us like 1000 steel at least. that would be nice too.
6282,so it most likely won't ever happen is what you're suggesting?
6283,it's totally not cum either.
6284,the executions and steel were the only reason i did it. but i never really tried to grind out the battle pass lol.
6285,"ah, the infamous number. now you must never play the game again to retain that number."
6286,that's like the average from what i've seen so far.
6287,it's fine. :)
6288,one day maybe lol.
6289,there was a pinned post  on this subreddit that said it. but you can probably find it on the for honor main site.
6290,nope because i basically never improve lol.
6291,"the amount stays the same throughout the entire battle pass, which is a good thing."
6292,"god does not dabble in the sharing of heretical narcotics. this is why i ask for your aid, god will deny me my access to such drugs."
6293,"it's 300 points per tier, so about 4-5 dominion games, or 5-6 ranked duels for one tier. the daily orders give 150 points as well."
6294,i think you get 10% more points than if you never had the premium pass. it should be 25% minimum imo.
6295,more like flex paste.
6296,"ah, get me in contact with him please?"
6297,yeah. warden is my most hated character.
6298,warden.
6299,"yeah, i know. like tyboo for example. but this guy claimed he never bought a single tier, just like me lol"
6300,they all look really nice lol. hope you're able to get them soon.
6301,"you're right. and with a lot of turtling, capitalising on the opponent's mistakes and prediction parrying. it's one of the worst times i've had in for honor in a while."
6302,that's not bad. you'll definetly get to tier 100 at this rate if that's your goal.
6303,i checked ubisoft club recently. that's the only reason i know lol.
6304,"the steel is nice too, and the champion status. but nothing else was good like those and the executions."
6305,nice. keep on going. you'll get to those nice executions soon. :)
6306,i'm rep 215. i've played for roughly 1415 hours since june 23rd 2018.
6307,"there was a guy who posted an image a few days ago showing that he completed the battle pass  there was a shugoki too,. i think it was his/her main. if that was him it would be funny."
6308,"207? jeez. i still think ranked duels is better because it's more efficient, but to be fair, i hated every second of it because i hate ranked."
6309,that's true. but just letting you know if you want it badly lol.
6310,yeah. i don't see a point in paying for the tiers personally anyways. 2500 steel for one tier is absurd...
6311,ah. get him or her to supply me with some black tar heroin please.
6312,i definetly play this game too much myself lol.
6313,"if you buy like £100 worth of steel and the battle pass, it won't be a grind at all as you can literally buy the entire battle pass."
6314,"personally i don't mind grinding the pass, it gives me something to do at atleast. i'm a shaman and jorm main myself. tier 80 odd and 90 odd for both weapon sets. that was annoying to see, but i got through it lol.

you can buy tiers though for steel, so if you buy steel then use it to upgrade the tiers after buying the battle pass you'll be able to get it. it's 20k though for 20 tiers which is fucking absurd imo. 2,500 for one tier as well..."
6315,i know. it's because i'm sad and sweat at this game lol. there was a guy a couple days ago who got the 100th tier too.
6316,the battle pass sure doesn't feel like it's value is that of a million steel like they said lol.
6317,basically ranked duels until i got an ornament for cent. then dominion.
6318,thanks. :)
6319,good luck. it's hell lol. if you're after anything specific in there i give you my blessings.
6320,"nope. i never really grinded the battle pass. it was more of a grind for a ranked ornament for cent, then after the event stuff. ranked duels give out a fair bit of points towards the pass and from what i found was the most effective in grinding the pass. a 10 minute dom game gives about 80 points. 25m breach game gave me about 115 points. a 3-4 minute ranked duel game gave me around 50 points."
6321,"i never actively grinded for the battle pass. i just played the game. but ranked duels was where i got the bulk of it grinding for a centurion ornament. you get between like 48-58 points per match. it's something along those lines anyways. i did play dominion too, but pvp only because i don't like pvai."
6322,that's still not that bad tbh.
6323,yeah. i believe it is. i've gotten anywhere between 70-110 from dominion iirc. and you can guess how long some dominion games have went on since the emotes lol.
6324,fair enough. i can't supply that unfortunately.
6325,i got like 46-58 per match in ranked. i don't recall whether that was for win or loss though.
6326,you've got plenty of time if you still plan on getting all the tiers. :) only reason i'm at tier 100 was because i was farming ranked duels for a centurion ornament and ranked duels gives a lot. it's probably the best farming method for it imo.
6327,it's totally lemonade.
6328,ah ok. thats fine.
6329,"i was getting bored of my old name anyways so it was worth it. plus, it gave me a way not to make me reject the fact i watched anime to others."
6330,no. you need the premium pass in order to get the weapons unfortunately.
6331,indeed i do. enough to justify an entire name change lol.
6332,nope. i need to grind for the event stuff still lol.
6333,that's still not bad. you'll definetly get to 100 if that's your goal.
6334,same lol. salvage was an abhorrent idea.
6335,i liked the executions. that's the only reason i bothered lol.
6336,yup. maybe add an exclusive emote and definetly get rid of salvage and replace that with something. and maybe increase steel amounts. those would be nice.
6337,yup lol. hopefully they take lessons from this battle pass and make the next one better.
6338,ubi money.
6339,i used to despise warlord too lol. then nuxia became a thing.
6340,if there is i'd gladly mute nuxia.
6341,you're basically gonna die in a gank no matter what anyways lol but i see your point. buffon's health numbers would be significantly easier than lowering many different damage values.
6342,"yeah, you have to be really quick though. basically as soon as you parry. you can't delay it at all"
6343,true. you have to turtle more than you'd turtle against a jormungandr to get the win lol.
6344,it's easier to just nerf his health so i'd reckon they'd go that route tbh.
6345,"i think you should buy warlord and spend 15k steel to lock nuxia. actually that would be spending money on nuxia, nevermind..."
6346,"it's a free win which means a chance for ranked rewards. there is no complaints here lol.

i remember going against 4 or 5 bots in a row. it was the happiest i've ever been in ranked."
6347,"all i care about is a shove nerf, health nerf and either make it so you can get an impale of light party only, or nerf the damage of it. 35 heavy parry punish that stuns and drains stamina is a totally fair and balanced move."
6348,rerorerorerorerorerorerorerorero
6349,i'm a shaman player and i agree.
6350,"they're music emotes. i think that's it really. they're unique and fun.

if i weren't saving up for valentine's day effect i would have them instantly lol."
6351,childcrusher is the best bot name.
6352,nice. i'm at 93 and haven't bought any tiers so far myself.
6353,"> jojofags

that's a new term i've never heard and i will proudly accept it for myself as it's true."
6354,it would be amazing for cent lol.
6355,he has to be an absolute unit man. a little midget running about with a machete isn't good in comparison to a 12 foot unit of a man.
6356,he has to be a 7 foot giant too wielding an 18 foot machete or else it wouldn't be good.
6357,that's annoying. thanks anyways though for clarifying.
6358,warden.
6359,"the mythic outfit ""furiously fast"" for the samurai is similar. it only has one menacing symbol on the effect though."
6360,"to be fair, i never use ubisoft club and only started looking into some rewards seeming as you mentioned it and i never knew you could rename yourself at all anyways."
6361,that's unfortunate. you need to change it to the correct spelling asap lol.
6362,the fact you spelt kira's name wrong irritates me lol.
6363,it's not hard as shaman really lol. the dashing heavy into unblockable heavy.
6364,35 damage heavy parry punish that stuns and drains stamina is trash.
6365,"fun is everything to me. if i'm not having fun with them, i won't play them. all the s tier characters are boring to play for me for example, except shaman if you count her as s tier as some people do."
6366,"yeah game pass and playstation now. i forgot playstation now has for honor on it, but it'd be laggy as hell for anyone playing through it lol."
6367,you need playstation plus or xbox gold to play the game online anyways though. i'm not sure about steam seeming as i haven't owned a computer since like 2013.
6368,"it's went free many times. it's been a playstation plus game, an xbox games with gold game, it was on the game pass too iirc. i know it's been free on certain pc sites as well."
6369,you can never have too much chaos lol.
6370,"yeah, but it's be more chaotic and therefore more fun imo."
6371,"oh aye, fuck yeah. let's go fucking see sonic."
6372,"if it had feats, then i'd agree. still a good gamemode though."
6373,you actually want to fucking go mate? i'll fucking go. go to the movies with you. what movie do you wanna see?
6374,noob. imagine ganking in 2v2's. so trash. i'm going to gank you now.
6375,childcrusher best bot.
6376,spin the bottle. the only thing that matters with him.
6377,"there's 3 effects, an ornament, a symbol and an outfit you can get for each character. i'm not sure if different gamemodes affect the drop rate, all i know does is time though. that affects drop rates i'm pretty sure.

oh, and if you get an ornament for say conqueror, you will not be able to get a 2nd one."
6378,i've changed the guard on nuxia's deflect before so i know it's possible. i haven't played nuxia since like last year when i regrettably bought her though.
6379,"yeah. they're cool, most of them at least."
6380,"you can change the direction of the deflect, but the opponent can still predict and block it, deflect it ect."
6381,"he's not a female dog. he's a monkey.

(i'm so funny, i know.)"
6382,you want to fuck shaolin? ok then.
6383,"yeah, you can get anything. the season thing just tells you what season it was made available in."
6384,"nah, i kinda like it like that. i can hide as shaman that way lol.

downvotes to the left."
6385,"damn, that's how fh looked pre alpha? it's came a looong way indeed."
6387,normiegandr.
6388,i'll execute all the male heroes for you then.
6389,i have no clue really lol.
6391,in my opinion gta 5 was abhorrent in comparison to rdr2. rdr2 is my favourite game and gta 5 is one of my least favourites.
6392,we are.
6393,yeah. i have.
6394,everyone's experiences are different. i know for a fact it never took an hour for me to complete a tournament.
6395,took like 30-35 minutes at most then to complete an entire tournament iirc. i much prefer it over ranked duels no matter what anyone says lol.
6396,it's not going to take an hour though. it never did. it took like 10-15 minutes at most when i did it to get in a game. i lost many times yet still preferred it over ranked duels.
6397,"yeah, but being guaranteed is better than chance."
6398,i wouldn't care lol. it guarantees ranked rewards so it's 100% better.
6399,"i agree. tournaments need to happen again, only because of the ranked rewards though. that's the only reason i'd play ranked.

i got put against many lawbringers which abuse the shove. i even had a guy message me apologizing for spamming shove with lb. you have to do whatever you can to win i guess.

many jjs which abuse i frames too and many pk light spammers which i can't parry yet i'm apparently worthy of a diamond 1."
6400,have fun going through hell.
6401,i believe tiandi and orochi can with the dodge attacks. the move and recovery is long enough to get the attacks off too.
6402,"it's kinda reactable the kick and if he tries to back flip to negate the punish, some characters can punish that with their movesets too.

and you're right there. don't know why i never thought of that lol."
6403,"he can't option select charged heavy anymore and he lost his quad dash because of it. i don't see his good defense personally unless i'm forgetting something 

and all he has in ganks is ranged gb and the slide tackle (i think) the former being not that good as you can just lock onto the shinobi."
6404,he basically is now imo. like he has literally nothing in his kit anymore except biggish damage which he won't ever get off.
6405,he's on about shinobi i'm pretty sure.
6406,"it's an easy win, so a chance to get ranked rewards. i see no problems"
6407,cent 115 damage punish laughs in your face.
6408,backstep light?
6409,"you can only get ranked rewards if you win, and that's still by chance. the only exception being the new effect which is guaranteed win or loss. i believe you're able to get ranked rewards in placement matches too."
6410,that's what i should've done but it'd basically be fighting hitokiri again and i don't like fighting hitokiri soooo yeah....
6411,last year i got the best shaman ornament accidentally and i was really happy. i only went on ranked that day because of one of those  event orders.
6412,warden. boring to fight. boring to play. too strong of a moveset.
6413,me
6414,"just light attack her out of it, it's really slow so you should be able too easily."
6415,"a good gladiator is fucking annoying to play against lol, it takes alot more to be good with glad than bp though. bp imo is boring to play with his reliance on bash offense. i'd say go for glad as he's more fun, but he's worse of the two."
6416,you are able i'm pretty sure.
6417,it's 100% worth it. it looks so nice. nice job.
6418,it's a good feeling. knowing you never need to play ranked again.
6419,"yeah, you can. just prepare to grind for a long time."
6420,"no. you can still get all tournament rewards from ranked matches, it's just way harder. they should not have gotten rid of tournaments. it made the grind so much easier."
6421,yikes. that's a big task. i hope you're able to get them all soon.
6422,you have to play warden in order to get his ornament. it's the same with everything i believe except the new effect after you have all the parts for the hero you're currently playing.
6423,i remember tournaments... it was how i got golden gargoyle for gladiator. i wish it made a comeback. a guaranteed ornament for winning was a good thing indeed.
6424,fair enough. i probably should've done that tbh but i'd be on the receiving end of the rework too which wouldn't be fun for the first week or two.
6425,you too man. :)
6426,you have to play the hero to get it. after you get everything for a certain character though i think it's then randomised.
6427,"surprisingly, yes, it does."
6428,thanks. :) i had to change my cent around though as the material on the wings doesn't change.
6429,it is a nice ornament indeed. but i feel bad for you as you spent 3 weeks on it.
6430,if you are determined you'll definetly get it. :)
6431,thanks man. :) i literally got every single other ornament before it so it was really frustrating lol.
6432,"i play ps4 and i actual found games relatively quick. i think it's because of the new effect which you can unlock guaranteed even if you lose.

and the platinum trophy, the hardest ones were definetly the tribute and death match ones. it should be possible to get the trophy via ai, i agree with that. if you team up with fellow trophy hunters i think you may be able to get games for the trophy."
6433,thank you man. now time to customize around it. sadly parts of it are not affected by materials though.
6434,if the long arm was actually useful then he'd be kinda better. i like that move but you can never hit it lol. they should at least made the shove more punishable and tune down the impaling riposte punish and i'll be happy.
6435,"right now i'm ever so slowly becoming more depressed in ranked as centurion fighting lawbringers, wardens ect so they never attempt to parry the variable charged heavy. they seem to rely on the shove alot so yeah."
6436,huh. just tried in training against a bot with dodge shove and counter gb and turns out you're right. you have to dodge really early though. but this might help me now that i know.
6437,79 days according to the battle pass.
6438,"unparriable bash, you'll be finished for attempting to punish it.

over the top parry punishes, even with his nerf. 35 damage heavy parry..."
6439,because you totally can gb his shove...
6441,"or how about you can press triangle to do a pre set emote so you can emote spam, then hold triangle to bring up an emote wheel."
6442,i know. it gets even more frustrating when i get things for characters i ain't using at the time. the only saving grace right now is that somehow i've been going against a lot of bots as of late somehow.
6443,i'm rep 208 so i have the knowledge and all that but it's because i'm playing cent. i can do absolutely nothing against players...
6444,"well winged victory is cool and i really want it. i've wanted it for a long time. i've been trying for like 3 hours daily over 4 days grinding for it. the only upside is that i'm progressing the battle pass at a faster rate than i would ever. oh, and i'd play other games if i had other games i want to play. i usually just spend my time on this, youtube or watching anime lol."
6445,"i'm not having fun at all really right now because i'm grinding ranked for a fucking ornament for one of the worst characters in the game (cent) and everyone is like 400 times better than me, when i do win i never get the thing that i want and i get stuff for other characters like highlander and pk. i don't know why i bother lol."
6446,"all i know is that damage reduction occurs when you get hit in hitstun, any move can apply damage reduction as long as it hits."
6447,"if you're from europe i don't mind helping. i say europe specifically because this game is region locked for the host. say the host is from asia and someone from na and someone from australia joins, everyone will go into an asian server. my internet can't handle that at some times.

plus, i don't have many people to play this with and wouldn't mind helping. be warned though even though i'm a high rep i ain't the best at explaining lol."
6448,"children are people too, so you can do two in one. fist children with your fingers."
6449,i've played every character but i absolutely refuse to play nuxia now. it's because it's nuxia and she's annoying. especially her voice and the caltrops lines.
6450,centurion.
6451,"yes, but i love it either way."
6452,"i know, but if you have it already for the character you're playing, it randomised. i was thinking maybe the ranked rewards like colours and ornaments do the same thing."
6453,"from my experience, that only happened to me with the effect and that was when i got the effect for centurion. i wonder if the same holds true for the colour palettes, ornaments and stuff too."
6454,"the darkness near consumed us. come, join us, not needlessly revive us."
6455,well fuck. i've played like 60 ranked games and it hasn't happened once to me. i suppose it's a rare occurrence then.
6456,that's going to happen to me i bet lol. i'll get everything except winged victory...
6457,is there any way to recreate this. it's one of the reasons i farmed the effect.
6458,storming tap to top heavy. the recovery of the zone can be gb'd with that punish i believe.
6459,what about baki?
6460,you don't have 6969 steel or 69 scavenger crates or 69 tiers in the battle pass. git gud.
6461,oh please let it be. a nerf to lb punishes is a good thing in my eyes.
6462,firebomb the carpark.
6463,not if the attackers are better than you though and have the proper feat/perk setups and optimal characters.
6464,"commander with less health? yay, going to love the spear storm + hito 4th feat combo."
6465,i don't see how someone can play for 70 reps with only one character playing noone else...
6466,i'm thankful dodge gb was rid of.
6467,all you need is the coin toss emote. even if there is no spam.
6468,newer players who don't know his moveset.
6469,"yeah. it's meant to be grinded. it's something to do in the game apart from the orders.

and it'll definetly feel satisfying to finally hit the 100th tier. those who bought it won't feel that satisfaction."
6470,"i feel like i saw a similar gladiator outfit in ranked duels a few hours ago lol.

i'd change the shield and maybe the trident. other than that i don't mind it."
6471,"exactly. and you see youtubers like tyboo dropping like 100k or 125k steel just to flex that they have the new executions. i really don't see the point, they're going to get it. they're for honor youtubers after all lol."
6472,"i like it all except the 100 salvage parts. for £10 it's a well good deal. plus, it gives me a reason to play. i don't understand why you'd want to buy tiers though..."
6473,"8👊=d👶

8=👊d👶

i am a pedo.

(jk plz don't sue me.)"
6474,"then anyone with hyper armour just laughs at glad's, and shinobi laughs because you don't need an input for his. but then he realises the state he's in and starts crying."
6475,"but when you get the deflect, it's so good lol, especially on berserker, shaman and orochi."
6476,wish i could be like that lol. i just end up eating like every light possible unless i'm blessed by the gods and am able to somehow parry them lol.
6477,and jorm i think.
6478,i play tiandi already though.
6479,true lol. but i guess it helps with your reactions to constantly be playing reflex heroes so that's an upside i'd think.
6480,"i played glad a fair bit before his buffs. i was like rep 10 with her, now i'm rep 13 with her iirc. i don't play assassin's much except from shaman tbh lol."
6481,"shaman, at rep 39. then jorm and rep 21. (i know, i'm sad.) but i haven't played them in a while."
6482,"i have patience too, otherwise i wouldn't be playing one of the worst characters in the game in tryhard galore lol."
6483,i've only played ranked for like 3 hours a day over the past two days. there's no way i'm making myself lose sleep over such a horrid gamemode lol.
6484,"i don't know what rank you are, but i'm diamond 1 and i'm getting constant matches which is a surprise in itself. i think it's because of the exclusive effect maybe? either way it benefits me as it gives me a better chance for the ornament lol."
6485,lucky man. i'm still after it. i have like every other ornament except that and that butterfly one.
6486,"yes, you can. you're just going to have to spend decades in ranked for it because ornaments are not fun to grind in ranked."
6487,those who ventured into the subreddit i linked will appreciate this.
6488,the maggot one definetly. nothing tops that perfection.
6489,"once you find a select post in there, it gets a whole lot better."
6490,you're forgetting 'ate wu lin.
6491,hey guys! wanna assassinate our teacher?
6492,"ah, my bad. by higher ranked players i thought you meant like their rep.

sometimes if you wait a while in matchmaking, the game will automatically try to connect you to games one to three tiers higher/lower. every two and a half minutes it will increase matchmaking by one tier both higher and lower up to 3 times, maybe more."
6493,just because they're a higher level doesn't mean they're better. like just there i went against a rep 30 odd overall and he slaughtered me with hitokiri on ranked duels.
6494,"true. i got another one for cent too, but it's still not the one i'm after. how not fun ranked is lol."
6495,chad male tiandi be screaming his own name though.
6496,it gets better once you look at a certain recentish post.
6497,"to be fair, they'd probably censor all of these swear words. i just want one so i piss off the enemy with it."
6498,exactly. monster hunter world has done it (probably alongside many other games) so i don't see how it isn't possible.
6499,r/insectsinsex
6500,"lol nice. i got cobra plume for cent but i have to resort to using worse internet to actually win. scummy, yes. but it's the only way i'm winning."
6501,i it do it if the opponent's are being cunts. i'll spam thanks! thanks! thanks! or sorry! sorry! sorry! while using the loudest effect noises possible. but sometimes i like to emote spam after a game even if they weren't toxic. i don't do it in a mean way i do it because it's fun to emote spam.
6502,"it's guaranteed every game by the way, even if you lose. it will always be for the character you're playing as and if you already have the effect then it's for a random character."
6503,"i'd agree, but ornaments."
6504,"why a hammer, why not a boeing c-17 globemaster iii?"
6505,and i'll do the same back.
6506,i'd smash that shaman.
6507,don't know why you'd want to play gta 5 tbh.
6508,"from the games i've played, warframe has a really nice community."
6509,say that to year 3 season 2.
6510,and you call a 90 second cool down balanced? 2 seconds seems balanced to me.
6511,do you mean a realm? if so then no. it's not a realm. it's a regular world he created not long ago.
6512,"yeah, that's true. but duels and all that are more boring imo."
6513,they've both only given me about 50 or 60 each iirc.
6514,i've not played regular duels or brawls so i'm not sure if they give the same amount.
6515,i'm at like 12 so far. from my experience i've gotten around the same amount of battle pass points in dominion as i have ranked duels.
6516,ps4 is the most populated platform so i'd say it's pretty active.
6517,i liked it. it has a unique artstyle to anything i've watched so far. the action isn't that bad either and i like all the characters. it probably is overrated but i'd give it a shot at least for a few episodes.
6518,for calling people sweats and stuff lol.
6519,"that's ranked for you. a bunch of sweats who either lagswitch or are complete god's which you won't get one hit on.

(probably gonna get downvoted. go on then.)"
6520,"just my spotify playlist which features anything from metal, to kinda relaxing stuff to anime music lol."
6521,i don't know if it's because you're from the us (i assume because dollars) and i'm from the uk. if ubi decided to tax then that is fucking depressing.
6522,personally i like all of the battle pass. for like £8 it's a nice deal. all except the salvage of course.
6523,"when i bought it i wasn't taxed, strange..."
6524,it's always been like this from what i've known.
6525,"i thought xbox was more strict tbh
 my friend says you can just spam report a person and they'll eventually get banned lol."
6526,"yeah, it's a series. it's been animated up to part 5 and i've read part 6 and am reading part 7."
6527,"well i play ps4, and they could report me for simply saying a swear word in a non offensive manner and i'd get banned because i would be violating tos."
6528,"jojo's bizarre adventures. it's the only anime that i'll ever read the manga for, so far."
6529,"that reminds me of one time when i was playing gladiator and all i did was spam toe stab. a guy sent me hate mail basically saying that i'm bad for spamming toe stab, yet he never tried to dodge it even though it was basically all i was doing. 

i just like to attempt to annoy them without giving them any way to report and ban me because tbh that's what i fear most."
6530,fair enough lol. i've done that sometimes myself yet nobody responded in a positive manner. the ones that are angry and call you trash no matter what will just never be nice from my experiences.
6531,"eh. it's not that bad imo. the gold goes nice on my centurion. i had those fireflies on him before.

and most assets are reused in this game anyway for emotes, executions and stuff too, but i agree that they should've used some original audio in it."
6532,"hate mail is so fun to get like honestly lol. that's the one good thing about a toxic community, players desperate to defend their fragile ego."
6533,true. if the game was more stable it's be way better. but it's not just ubi's fault. it's the players's sometimes too.
6534,"ah, true. well it's something you'd have to put up with. nobody likes high latency players though. it's always a pain to go against them lol"
6535,you should try get a wired internet connection or a booster like i have to try and improve it if you want to play 4's more often.
6536,"i personally prefer the 4v4 gamemodes like dominion and stuff so i'm not that good in 1v1's as a result. especially ranked. winning a game for me is like winning the lottery, it's just not going to happen lol. but with the rank resets i might actually stand a chance whenever i play it now."
6537,i've not played ranked enough for that glitch to happen to me thankfully. this is why i wish ranked tournaments were here so you could get a guaranteed ornament. it's the only reason i have like 4 ornaments for gladiator and 2 for conqueror. i do not like ranked duels at all.
6538,you have some determination. i gave up on cent. i literally went against a god black prior who was like in masters when i was in diamond 1... then there's an aramusha one which doesn't look bad that i want. i also want the new effect as it's glitchy as fuck lol.
6539,haha nice. we can be golden gargoyle brothers lol.
6540,"yeah. i think most people just get angry and just bash the game, as i do. but i'm not going to make like 10 posts detailing why lawbringer is an unfun character to fight. i'm sure people do like it, just sometimes anger gets in the way of that."
6541,"shaman, jorm, tiandi, aramusha in that order."
6542,"my hero academia

assassination classroom

demon slayer

those 3 fit at least one of the categories so you might enjoy them."
6543,r/insectsinsex
6544,"some of the criticism is good criticism but most of it is just saying to nerf or delete the annoying characters. the community is pretty toxic unfortunately though, but it's something that won't change. at least any time soon that is...

but still, i don't mind the direction this game is going, the battle pass gives me more incentive to play, even if it is a bit grindy. no other game is like for honor, and that's what makes it good. the combat is fun, the executions and emotes and all that are pretty good too. even though i talk shit about the game a fair bit when i'm annoyed at it, it's a game i'll always come back too. i hope it doesn't die out, i hope it thrives for a long time."
6545,for £8 the battle pass is pretty good. the only complaint i have is the fact they have tiers dedicated to salvage... other than that i like it.
6546,"he never got new armour.

nvm i'm retarded. i was thinking year 1 sorry."
6547,aye totally 100%.
6548,that's not nice. big bully.
6549,"because it's reddit.

also, here's another similar subreddit for you. r/selffuck, enjoy."
6550,fair enough lol.
6551,r/selfsuck can help with that.
6552,oh. i never knew that. makes sense though. cheers for elaborating.
6553,oh. that's unfortunate. wish i could've got it early but oh well. but why does the us get it early though? bit unfair.
6554,it's confusing to me lol. i've seen the western theme showcasing what it looks like and all that stuff online already so some people must already have it.
6555,yeah. i watched it a while ago because of one scene i saw online. it wasn't that bad imo.
6556,alright. thanks. hope you get them lol.
6557,centurion's winged victory i believe it's called please.
6558,i'm pretty sure you can dodge the bash and heavy on the same timing. (might be wrong) try against bots and see if it works?
6559,"once you do, get me some will you?"
6560,you only need rah lol.
6561,it probably will be tbh.
6562,"oh, and maybe a tumbleweed going past too?"
6563,i will probably persevere to the end of iceborne's story at least. but i did want to at least try get the platinums for mhw if i can. so that will probably see me through for a long while.
6564,oh. well i think i've made myself a decent set for now. cheers man. :)
6565,yeah. i've upgraded defense. but the problem i think is i'm not using master rank gear. so i'm having to do that now which is unfortunate as i wanted to save resources and stuff.
6566,"so basically just treat it how you would the start of mhw? anything so i can stand a chance, albeit terrible looking armour/weapons lol. thanks for the tip though. i just thought i'd wait until i could basically build the build i have now but with master rank armour."
6567,yikes. i haven't even fought velkana yet. not looking forward to instant death lol.
6568,stop calling it vortiger. it's black prior.
6569,"he's getting a little buff, but not to his shouting lol."
6570,welp. he is getting the hitokiri 2.0 rework year 4 season 2 most likely. so you're wishes have not been granted lol.
6571,i'm rep 200 and i still hate it lol. i barely ever guess correctly and when i do they zoom like 700 miles past me to croatia and they're out of guard break range.
6572,well it's a haymaker nerf but still. only 15/20 damage toe stab now is sad times.
6573,especially because of the big damage. unfortunately gladiator is getting nerfed so only 15 damage toe stab. :(
6574,"viking village, please ubi."
6575,25 damage toe stab. it's all you need.
6576,"gonna get downvoted, who cares.

warden. the worst bash in the game. sure having an unreachable offense is a good thing, but having the bash usable from a back dodge, being able to feint it while moving, over the top damage (at least for stage 3) and getting the top heavy when you go oos is too much. 

his fashion is good though. only good thing i'll say about him. but that doesn't make up for his shitty and boring moveset."
6577,"persona 5 dancing in starlight theme

6580,love you too hun.
6581,"welp. if you plan on retaining a good life, please refrain from watching it."

6586,this happened to me at the end of a long breach game. i was so very happy afterwards...
6587,"yup. it's really weird. if you value your life, i wouldn't watch it."
6588,"if you do, have fun with no sanity afterwards."
6589,"definitetly abunai sisters.

(joking, don't watch it. i repeat, don't.)"
6590,please nerf shove next ubi. please. i beg of thee.
6591,oh shit. you're right. now the song is stuck in my head. thanks.
6593,"they're all bad. the best you're going to get is with an event emote.

the best one that you can buy though in my opinion is the 7k combat emote ""spear twirl"" i think it's called that at least."
6594,"berserker can recover from a whiffed heavy by doing a dodge, so he could possibly bait deflects that way?

i know shaman can backwards step heavy hitokiri's heavy, it will whiff if the hitokiri goes through with the kick (i think you can punish with the soft feint to bleed but i'm unsure) and trade if he does the sweep. you can also feint and dodge the sweep in time and get a gb."
6595,"rah, or jorm rah.

(second is shaolin dudududu)"
6596,"maybe i've always gb'd too late as i was surprised, idk."
6597,eh. it wasn't really a habit to backdodge for me. it was more i did it like when i didn't expect an attack but the enemy did one anyway.
6598,i guess that explains why the few times i backdodged certain characters bashes i couldn't gb them.
6599,"oh, the more you know. never knew they had different recovery."
6600,really? fair enough lol. i don't see how but oh well.
6601,knowing ubi they'd charge 5k steel to change hair colour. but i love this idea. could do the same with the pikemen and gave your emblem on their shields perhaps?
6602,"because back dodges aren't normal.

seriously though. only reason i thought of that being the case was because you could back dodge to backroll like anything and maybe it would make the turtle meta back in the day less prevalent if that makes sense? i can't explain it well lol."
6603,fair enough. i might've been at a distance then. i don't remember every back dodge i've done after all lol.
6604,"an asthmatic japanese person who wears a bin bag as her helmet

6605,i've dodged with it before though. maybe the attacks that hit have really good forward momentum or something? or back dodges have less i-frames?
6606,it's because ubisoft totally has the no.1 servers.
6607,"not if you had 41-50 health left.

but i'm just joking about. it's not the most useful nerf about but at least it's something."

6612,"if you do decide to go for it, i've got a tip that might help increase your chances. you need to genuinely want everything else from ranked rewards except that colour scheme. it's a known fact you always get things you don't want, so if you genuinely want everything else except that colour scheme your chances of getting it will improve tenfold."
6613,"i'm not really into cars or races or anything. i initially started watching it because of the meme songs in it. but it wasn't bad at all. if you like racing and cars and all that, i'll think you'll enjoy it.

oh, and personally i think it got a bit better as it went on, especially the final race. i liked that one."
6614,i'm not trying to be funny. i genuinely hate the regular handler. i prefer the serious handler.
6615,they can't handle the thought of a nerf to their main's safest bash in the game.
6616,to be fair it's true though. i hate the regular handler.

6622,mine is too. i've sinned.
6623,on st patrick's day there's an exclusive event. it's a really nice effect basically and i want it badly.
6624,"his uncharged opener heavy, which is getting nerded from 600ms to 700ms to prevent a heavy from heavy parry is getting a buff to 30 damage from 25.

his pounce after charged punch is not confirmed after a charged pounce anymore. the trade off is that the damage is increased from 35 damage to 45 damage.

i believe his lights are getting small damage increases too but i'm not sure on the actual amounts if i'm correct. it's probably going to be 1-3 damage increases.

oh, haymaker won't work with the three pommel bashes after guard break which is a damage nerf in a sense.

and these values, and everything i've said is not final. it could all change. this was just from the testing grounds that happened late last year."
6625,"it's definetly a buff overall, but imo he's going to be a bit more annoying to fight.

oh, and you know how his parry punish is a knee bash to confirmed heavy? the heavy will no longer be confirmed, only a light will be confirmed."
6626,i'm more excited for st. patrick's day. i've waited too long for the effect...

6638,"fair enough. looks aren't enough though for me. it's all about their movesets. if i don't like them, i won't play them regardless of fashion. like my two mains have some of the worst fashion in the game according to many people."
6639,backdodge bash. that's all you need for one of the most boring characters in for honor.
6640,asshole stretched wider than the great wall of china.
6641,oh i've made a grave error in life...
6642,"only 3 minutes each? i could actually possibly survive against it then... it's not going to ever be attempted any time soon, and i'll probably forget it. (which is probably for the better tbh.)"
6643,"i have a rule where i won't drop an anime. if it's really that bad, i don't want to waste 3 and a half hours of my life roughly on it.

i might watch a video on youtube about it though. maybe i can waste 20 minutes of my life and lose half my braincells."
6644,"yikes. a 2.52 rating on mal? i looked it up thinking it couldn't be that bad. every review was negative, and the two 10/10's were them just fucking about. that's the lowest score i've ever seen for an anime. can that even be topped?"
6645,"i'm pretty sure no game no life has a couple, but it's been ages since i last watched it so i can't confirm anything."
6646,thank yowo for apowogizing.
6647,"
you're forgetting big owo energy too :("
6648,"shit...

umm, nobushuwu?"
6649,nobuwusuwuhi
6650,dynamax garbodor.
6651,eh. i get that a lot.
6652,"oh shit! timmy, move!!!"
6653,no clue who he is. but he's sounds like a decent person.
6654,"so is nouwushi.

and so am i. evident by my previous comment."
6655,"oh, did i say pedo? what i meant is pedro. i get mixed up quite a bit because pedro touches little boys.

^^^ooh, ^^^dark, ^^^i ^^^know."
6657,the more you know. cheers.
6658,"wait anthony, are you bullying your brother pedro again? you know not to turn on and off the lights as he doesn't want to do the juice wrld challenge. apologize to pedo right now."
6659,i expected to be mass downvoted by the spliced fanboys. never expected to be right lol.
6660,"it's spliced. he probably still does unlock tech on lawbringer and begs for buffs.

(gonna get downvoted, i know i am.)"
6661,it's unique voice lines which is good because i think this is the first time conq got the unique voice line treatment.
6662,haha same. you're getting more content from the battle pass too i believe.
6663,i hope not. i think £7 is a well good price. is that even legal to round it up and sell it for more in other countries?
6664,"i thought they were all like £14 or like $20 so it's a surprise to me, a guy who never buys battle passes."
6665,those are some cursed tags.
6666,"it's a marketing tactic i believe. £3.999 looks way cheaper than £4,000 even though it's one pound off. it's more of an incentive to buy as it appears cheaper."
6667,jormungandr.
6668,"well, he somehow figured it out. don't share it with him, and don't make it something obvious like triangle triangle triangle triangle."
6669,i think it has nothing to do with being mad. it's how lawbringer trains for battle. it's quite accurate and a pretty common way to train actually.
6670,that is quite a username...
6671,you can make it so you have to input a custom code each time you want to sign into your own account.
6672,you don't need certification.
6673,after the maintenance i would personally assume.
6674,bad fingernails gang.
6675,i would say jormungandr's tier 4 feat but you specified 1v1s...
6676,definetly put it on highlander. but if it wallsplats they'd definetly need to nerf opener heavy damage. but it's give me more reason to play him.
6677,"i've seen worse. the knights or samurai, forgot which one. they pushed all the way up to the vikings main base thingy. like how lol. especially how they mostly all care for the faction war."
6678,we do get content of the week at least like twice a month if that counts for anything.
6679,"i actually like some of his stuff and actually can make him look good in my opinion.

but hitokiri though..."
6680,"can confirm: shaman has coronavirus and so do i.





^^^help ^^^me ^^^please..."
6681,nothing. but he's getting a rework to become hitokiri 2.0
6682,yas. i like those ideas. i also read somewhere that he should be given dodge forward gb. this could make his kick an actual mixup. dodge and take a 30 damage gb heavy or take the 28 damage dodge forward heavy. add that to the list and i think that would make him good.
6683,warden for all except style. that title goes to nuxia.
6684,"that's most definetly a cringe micah.

(jk love you really. it's just micah is cringe so y'know.)"
6685,kono martin luther king niwa yume ga aru.
6686,don't worry. you can be gay in persona 5 on march 31st.
6687,"are you kidding me? like are you actually serious. that's a literal nerf to his kit.

you want to know a real buff? ok, i'll tell you. any attack warden throws out, if it hits or blocks. it will automatically disconnect the entire enemy team and give them a 15 minute matchmaking penalty."
6688,only one i've heard so far is easy breezy from eizouken or whatever it's called. it's actually a right banger.
6689,flair is quite accurate once they catch you staring through the second floor window.
6690,rep 200 and yes. fuck level 3 bots lol. i can do nothing against them except when i'm playing highlander.
6691,"story mode and the breakables inside story mode. and also i think it's the warriors trials, they give a fair bit of steel. one time only though.

other than those you're main source are the orders."
6692,persona 5 royal from my knowledge is added content that isn't in persona 5. the way the games are made and the content they add require  the dlc to be bundled into a new game and sold separately. the persona 5 royal deluxe edition adds even more than what's in persona 5 royal already. i don't exactly know what's it but persona 5 was so good i didn't care. they deserve the money for making a great game.
6693,"haha. i basically never preorder games but i had to drop £85 on the preorder to persona 5 royal digital deluxe edition. it's as you said, i have faith in the developers, aka atlus as persona 5 was a superb game. and i've actually never played and resident evil game if that's what re stands for. i remember one of the resident evil games was a ps+ game, but i never got around to playing it."
6694,ubi needs money. i'd wait until it's like 50% off at least.
6695,it'd go for more then. but i understand that. i'd never sell my account with nearly like £1000 spent on games.
6696,persona 5 dancing star night theme.
6697,yikes. ps4 accounts with p.t go for so much money lol. i'm jealous.
6698,boring. cool executions though.
6699,yas. fellow shaman main unite. we shall bite to victory.
6700,"you can buy the outlaw pass for gold on red dead redemption 2 which you can save up for so it's possible you can buy it for steel, i just expect it to cost like 30k steel to buy."
6701,they're not thankfully.
6702,that's not very engin miskunn of you.
6703,i already know the number. i just forgot most of the contents of it.
6704,cursed? clearly blessed by the gods what you on about?
6705,"light bash light.
light bash light.
light bash light.
light bash light.
light bash light.
light bash light."
6706,"oh, and bonquerors."
6707,that is true.
6708,he's more balanced than lawbringer. i'll give you that.
6709,break you down break you down break you down kousiteasiyu
6710,"oh, add whore hitokiri/warden too.  (i'm prepared for the warden mains to downvote me.)"
6711,"lol fair enough. we all have our opinions. 

if there was a deleting skank nuxia expansion though, i'd pay top dollar."
6712,i like the wu lin personally. i like all the wu lin except the abhorrent beast nuxia. but i only really play tiandi and shaolin out of them.
6713,"female tiandi's is just way more annoying, but i like it that way because i play male tiandi."
6714,the counter is just to go to their home and burst their eardrums with female tiandi voicelines earrape.
6715,aramusha first though. he's almost abhorrent.
6716,but female jormungandr/zhanhu though. they are not fun to hear.
6717,i love screaming in my opponent's face tbh.
6718,"yi bi nai yi.

(i know i butchered the spelling, ok.)"
6719,my dad etched that on one of my siblings graves. it's what caillou wished for after all...
6720,trophy hunters.
6721,"50? what are you, fucking insane? it needs to do 150 damage minimum and drain stamina, stun, is unblockable and is 233ms."
6722,aw.
6723,"ey, let me try. i think i'll be cursed today. (794471)"
6724,:(
6725,she has the coronavirus.
6726,"you're telling the truth an all... for fucks sakes. 

thanks anyways..."
6727,can i please get a link to this?
6728,wait. when'd they say they will add executions?
6729,"yup. you could also make gb softfeintable from a kick too, but i think having dodge forward gb goes in line with his moveset with all the dodges."
6730,"they could increase its range, or reduce the range of the kick and speed up the dodge forward heavy by like 100ms or so in conjunction. i think that would fix the issue personally."
6731,i think dodge forward heavy should be guaranteed then this would be a good idea. most people would just take the kick and not risk the gb.
6732,you could sail the high seas if you're willing to do that.
6733,guess i have supercancer then.
6734,murder is clearly the logical answer...
6735,i liked all of it. but people say the manga is better. i wouldn't know though as i don't like reading manga.
6736,we shall indeed.
6737,we definetly will be fine but ok.
6738,we'll be fine lol.
6739,"not op but i've heard a plagues tale: innocence is really good, and it just recently got added. i hope it's good as i'm downloading it lol."
6740,make him pepsiman. that's all you need to do.
6741,"jj, kensei and bp are all really good because of their kits and damage potential.

but surprisingly, jorm and tiandi are pretty decent because of their health/shield gain feats."
6742,berserker lights because it's berserker lol. that's all.
6743,"definitely shaolin. better emotes, executions, fashion, signatures, moveset and voicelines. and all of those are more fun anyways."
6744,replace peacekeepers crossbow feat with an uzi. that will make her balanced.
6745,"a battle occurs once every 8 or 12 hours, so you need to do this at most twice for 25 days i believe."
6746,oh... well then... didn't expect one to actually happen already.
6747,this is far from spam. it's a blessing from the gods alerting you to your well-being.
6748,fuck.
6749,next some nuclear meltdown will occur in a populated area.
6750,"shaman, jorm, tiandi, and aramusha."
6751,hopefully it is so.
6752,ah yes. my bad.
6753,"peacekeeper, first rep was nobushi though. regret playing nobushi though. she's boring as fuck to play."
6754,"no. it's an intended feature. see, highlander was actually given unparriable unblockable lights recently, and that's what he used on you.


^^^/s ^^^obvs"
6755,"shaman, jormungandr, tiandi."
6756,no. it's uwubwinger.
6757,"yeah. that skirmish trophy... unless you want to spend days grinding for wins, you won't have any luck with it. but don't buy the game just for a platinum. buy it if you want to play it, the platinum doesn't really matter."
6758,corpse party is a horror anime i believe. it's very short though.
6759,"oh my, that does sound better. then he's just laughing maniacally while he's bashing their head in."
6760,"i don't believe this at all. you got into a death match? keep on dreaming.

^^^/s ^^^plz ^^^don't ^^^bully ^^^me."
6761,he's fun to play. his executions are cool. his emotes are cool.
6762,"hmm. i think it should, he could destroy the head but continue to bash where the head could be perhaps for a couple bashes until he realises the head has been completely destroyed. 

ooh, then he could quickly get up and either laugh or have a voice line."
6763,"jormungandr to throw his hammer so it hits the opponent in the head. then he jogs over to them, picks up the hammer and just bashes it into the opponent's head quickly multiple times."
6764,it's happening with me too...
6765,"i love jiriki hongan revolution from assassination classroom

and fighting gold from jojo's bizarre aadventures."
6766,500ms lights but keep the 300ms or 400ms crushing counter window.
6767,his bash. it's one of the strongest. that's why he's annoying. i understand it's all he has but it's depressing nonetheless to fight a warden.
6768,yosuga no sora.
6769,alright just describe me mostly why don't you.
6770,"why shaman? :( why could t it be an annoying character like warden, or lawbringer. why bully shaman? she's done nothing wrong. :("
6771,shaman.
6772,year 4 season 2 i'm pretty sure. then the hero after that year 4 season 4.
6773,"easiest: none

hardest: all of them"
6774,sounds like an invitation
6775,beautiful.
6776,you can use the site too. that's what i did before getting my xbox one.
6777,"nah, you're fucking trash at this game if you can't parry orochi lights from a 200+ ping player. you're also trash if you can't parry catapult, like that's such an easy parry, come on..."
6778,"i thought he was high b tier. but he is well hard to learn, but he has some of the best emotes and executions in the game so it's worth it."
6779,i finished watching it a few days ago. it was really good. almost made me cry which was a first in anime.
6780,i never will watch shows when they come out on a weekly basis. the only exception to this will be when jojo's bizarre adventures part 6 comes out.
6781,"""kind of sad"" he says..."
6782,i haven't seen it but i already know what you're referring too sadly lol.
6783,yeah. you're right. i forgot about it because i never use it lol. it's good for pressure as you say though
6784,"shaman has tons of mixup potential. for example, you can soft feint her chain finisher heavies into dodges, this means you can soft feint the  unblockable into a pounce if the opponent is bleeding for example. you can soft feint finisher heavies into gb's too, even hard feint into a zone attack or heavies which can be soft feinted again. 

just from her zone attack you can go through with it, soft feint into bleed, hard feint, hard feint into double light, hard feint into heavy soft feint bleed. hard feint to gb. and those are just some examples. i can't reiterate enough that you need to mix her attacks up. go into practice and practise a bunch of mixups.

oh, and her dodge attacks count as chain starters so you can do a dodge forward attack into heavy soft feinted into a dodge forward heavy, creating an infinite chain of sorts.

oh, and here's the max punishes

heavy parry: first half of a zone attack or double lights. (you can also go for a bite, but it isn't guaranteed so feint it and do it again. most people will automatically dodge the first)

light parry, bite or heavy.

gb: heavy from any side.

oos parry, side dodge heavy into unblockable (or when bleeding side dodge heavy into unblockable soft feint dodge into pounce.)

oos throw, forward dodge heavy into unblockable

her bash guarantees the first half of a zone, double light, or a heavy if it wallsplats.

if you're oos and you gb, you get a light, same on light parry. if you wallsplat i think you get a heavy but it depends on distance.

welp. that's all i can think of right now. hope it helps. if you have any more questions, i can try and answer them."
6785,"in the wild, cockodile."
6786,well then. you win this thread.
6787,"when i was farming in ice brawls i got hate mail from my teammate. tbh i probably deserved it as i didn't play as i just wanted the colours.

guess you could say those were bad games."
6788,you can delay celtics curse's soft feints and the attacks after if you so need to.
6789,that's not nice.
6790,incre incre incre incre incredibilis!!!
6791,"every time i get stunned by stun traps, my eyes get raped by the effect."
6792,"i never have. i believe we should always have the option to play who we want. it's one of the reasons i don't like r6s, if your character gets picked, you can't do anything about it."
6793,nah. you're right. this is 100x better. i can see it now.
6794,"what if lawbringer impaled a soldier and then balanced the poleaxe upright, showing the dead soldier balanced on top of it?  almost like the impaler execution i think it is."
6795,yup. that's what i do. the only exception being jojo's bizarre adventures: stone ocean and the following anime adaptations when they come out.
6796,"yeah. but i'd like to play characters i enjoy. i don't want to be constrained to terrible characters i don't enjoy. as it is, i only like a very select few of the roster."
6797,i'm proud.
6798,single pick? yay. i love not playing characters i like.
6799,"obviously cent, but i do hope aramusha  and orochi get put in there (moreso aramusha) i really want an aramusha buff badly lol."
6800,probably jojo's bizarre adventure. i'd love to rewatch it like it's my first time mainly because it's my first and favourite anime i've watched.
6801,like i'd know. i don't like that stuff lol. i was joking around.
6802,"cock and ball torture (cbt), penis torture or dick torture is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. this may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking.[1] the recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. many of these practices carry significant health risks.[2]

devices and practices

￼

￼

￼

￼

top left: erotic electrostimulation. top right: trampling the penis. bottom left: wax play. bottom right: chastity piercing.

similar to many other sexual activities, cbt can be performed using toys and devices to make the penis and testicles more easily accessible for attack, or for foreplay purposes.[3][4]

ball stretcher

￼

a metal ball stretcher and cock ring, which forces penis' erection.

a ball stretcher is a sex toy that is used to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. this can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up. intended to make one's testicles permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the male genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if over-tightened.

while leather stretchers are most common, other models consist of an assortment of steel rings that fastens with screws, causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer's testicles. the length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches.[5] a more dangerous type of ball stretcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one's scrotum until it is eventually stretched to the desired length.

ball crusher

a ball crusher is a device made from either metal or often clear acrylic that squeezes the testicles slowly by turning a nut or screw. how tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. a ball crusher is often combined with bondage, either with a partner or by oneself.

parachute

a parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. it is conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached.

used as part of cock and ball torture within a bdsm relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. moderate weights of 3–5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage, though occasionally much heavier weights are used. smaller weights can be used when the male wearing it is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.[citation needed]

humbler

￼

man with humbler

a humbler is a bdsm physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a bdsm scene.

the humbler consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. this forces the wearer to keep his legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing anything from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

testicle cuffs

a testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. a common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. they are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. a standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.

some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. there is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. the cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.[citation needed]

however, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. more conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

making the penis appear longer. pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view.

improving sexual arousal. while some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes.

preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse.

delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". it is much harder to reach an orgasm.

cock harness

a cock harness is a penile sex toy designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. its function is similar to that of a cock ring. these devices are often associated with bdsm activities. the gates of hell is a male chastity device made up of multiple cock rings that can be used for cbt.[6] kali's teeth is a metal bracelet with interior spikes that closes around the penis and can be used for preventing or punishing erections.[7]

ball busting

￼

ball busting demonstration in public at folsom street fair, usa

""ball busting"" is the practice of kicking or kneeing men in the testicles. it carries several medical risks, including the danger of testicular rupture from blunt trauma.

cbt in japan

tamakeri (玉蹴り) (lit. ball kicking) is a sexual fetish and subgenre of bdsm within which a man's testicles are abused. the genre is also referred to as ballbusting (""bb"" for short).[8][9] tamakeri is the japanese term, but it is used by many non-japanese people to describe media where asian people—mainly women—are participating in it. the dynamics of tamakeri consist of a masochist having their testicles hurt by a sadist.[10] the fetish is popular among heterosexual and homosexual men and women.[11] in hentai communities, it is often identified by either ""tamakeri"", or ""crotch_kick"".[12][13]

denkianma (電気按摩) (lit. ""electric massage"") is a popular japanese prank played between two people where one person puts their foot into the genital area of the other and shakes it in a vibrating motion.[14][15] often this is done by grabbing the other person's feet, raising them, and then placing one's own foot on their crotch and vibrating it. this is often done between school aged boys as a prank similar to kancho and could be seen by a western audience as a type of bullying. in 2007 the crisps company doritos released a new flavour of potato chip called ""denkianma"".[16]

safety

this section needs attention from an expert in health. the specific problem is: concerns medical topics, but lacks appropriate citations.

loss of blood flow is one of the biggest risks in cock and ball torture (cbt), which can be seen with loss of color and edemas.[17] bondage in which the testicles are tied to something else is especially dangerous, increasing the risk of the testicles getting damaged through excessive tension or pulling.

the most serious injuries are testicular rupture, testicular torsion and testicular avulsion, which are medical emergencies that require urgent medical attention.[18]

￼

urethral fingering is an example of cbt which needs special precautions, such as not having a sharp nail on the finger inserted inside penis. image shows a woman doing urethral fingering.

 

￼

a woman holding a bound man's penis applies electricity to his testicles at folsom street fair. it is important that such erotic electrostimulation is done within limits.

 

￼

a gagged man's penis and scrotum are pulled using a rope at folsom street fair. it is important to have a signal as a safeword during such activities.

 

￼

a dominatrix bites a gagged man's penis, while pulling and squeezing his testicles with her hand, at folsom street fair. it is important to remember the man's limits during such acts."
6803,nobody needs it when r/34honor exists.
6804,oh yeah. testing grounds. i forgot about it lol.
6805,you can get the colours in arcade if you have it.
6806,it's not been announced sadly. :( i really hope it isn't a japanese exclusive game.
6807,"cursed? you clearly don't understand. it's the furthest from cursed. it's pure beauty. it's an art form, lathering cum all over your body, inside and out. it gave me a feeling like none other. now i frequent the grand archives daily to bathe in the hot sticky mess. i've even taken to collecting my own cum and paying other strangers to cum in my bathtub just so i can lay in there. (hey, i might even do a belle delphine and sell the cum water.)"
6808,"i knew it wasn't. yet i dunked my head every chance i got for that sweet sticky juice. couldn't get enough of it. next i was bathing in it. this still wasn't enough. i wanted more. i gobbled some cum down and next thing i knew, i became a living cum cell, i even have my own little tail. cool, huh?"
6809,i think 400ms omnidirectional lights are a bit much already. i wouldn't want to see an increase in speed even further.
6810,os lights are 400ms already though. hate they buffed the stamina cost so instead of 4 of them until he's oos he can spam like 8 lol.
6811,nuxia does.
6812,the fact they have a dick makes it 10x better.
6813,nope. play who you like. i personally love jorm. he's my 2nd main. he's a mix of shaman and tiandi to me. loud as fuck and a condition rewarding you a 50 damage punish. i love him.
6814,"seeming as the japanese version of p5r came out late october last year and is coming out in late march this year, i assume p5s will come out around 6 months after the japanese release. (we can only hope. they better make a english version. i so want to play it.)"
6815,downvoted for an opinion. the reddit classic. imo ds1 is the worst game on that list. i've played them all except demon souls lol.
6816,"mortal kombat 11 off the top of my head. got it because my friends had it, hated the game (even with friends) and sold it to buy sekiro."
6817,least it's not a tryhard group.
6818,"welp. i saw somewhere there is an ai in the making to give the perfect blowjob, so it's possible if it's true lol."
6819,"oh, and the pope slapped a woman or something."
6820,"oh lol. i'm dumb, sorry."
6821,so zhanhu can?
6822,black shaman. a living demon.
6823,"you actually main highlander. wow, what a light spammer... 600ms lights are so op."
6824,"there's an easy way to not get spoiled never move outside your house again while being disconnected from any and all social media. seriously though, ive avoided most spoilers for a game i've wanted since october 2019. it's not that hard really."
6825,exactly lol.
6826,there was a man and a man. the man liked the other man. the other man liked man too. man confessed to other man. man accepted his feelings and man and other man become boyfriends. man fucking railed other man to death with his 40 inch cock. man feels guilty. man jumps off building. man dead.
6827,i don't really even consider emote spamming toxic unless they spam the chat while doing it.
6828,"yeah. that's why i've never thought weeb was an offensive term. i've basically thought it just means it's someone who just watches anime, but being called a weeaboo is worse as you say."
6829,just repeat muda over and over until you reach the character limit.
6830,"i've never thought of it as an insult. i always think of it as ""someone who watches anime"""
6831,that remind me of the orochi's with bunny ears and cherry blossom effect.
6832,"i always thought weeb and weeaboo were two separate things. am i right in saying it is now as by what you're saying, before it wasn't."
6833,"it's my first time too, and i find it boring lol. yet, i have to play it constantly for the event colours..."
6834,"feint your death and be reborn, but then feint that."
6835,i still think he needs one where he bats the enemy away (like his heavy after gb) and full on sprints and belly bounces on the enemy.
6836,weeb isn't really even an insult so it's funny really.
6837,yesterday i got disconnected 3 times and my interest is usually fine. funny thing is i live in europe.
6838,"i'm pretty sure you can't get the colours after the event ends, even in arcade."
6839,welp. at least it's something to do other than watching youtube and anime lol.
6840,yeah. i don't like waiting for the matches too as the gamemode is slowly dying from my experience so far. a way to turn off matchmaking would be good too as the bots are disabled in this gamemode. (thankfully lol)
6841,the steel rewards are worth it more than the faction war rewards.
6842,"i wished this lasted two weeks. i farm everything except event weapons and i've never been so bored in my life. i spent 6 hours today in ice brawls, 2 of which was just basically killing myself/letting the enemy kill me over and over..."
6843,civil discussion? no need. it's fucking stupid lol.
6844,"only base game and year 1 heroes have event weapons. but yes, any gamemode works."
6845,ok.
6846,0 minutes a second.
6847,it's not always two. sometimes you only get 1. and it's pvp only so it really depends on who you're fighting. i've had 3 minute games and 10 minute games.
6848,you also get them only in the event gamemode which is what i'm suffering through as we speak.
6849,jormungandr because at least he stands a chance against players lol.
6850,was it a drop attack?
6851,rather not remove a character i've spent about 70k steel on lol.
6852,jormungandr. there's literally no other contender for me there.
6853,turn up the deadzone i think it is called so you don't accidentally go into it by pushing a fraction of a millimetre down on the analog stick.
6854,"nah. that's so tame. it's comparable to being hit in minecraft. literally nothing happens lol. 

^^^jk ^^^obvs"
6855,i want shaman to do something savage. same with jorm lol.
6856,"ah yes, beauty."
6857,"you don't need to win them, thank fuck that it's like that."
6858,least it makes the medic ones easier tbh.
6859,"ai, fun? impossible."
6860,"probably. but i was thinking that that could refer to multiple things. say someone needs revived, another getting ganked, and another wanting you to capture an objective. people could probably get mistaken and it might cause unnecessary hate. we all know how toxic the for honor community is lol."
6861,"i know, but only playing as an attacker. i'd like it even for defenders toi."
6862,"""coming to revive"" needs to be an option in dominion and the other gamemodes imo."
6863,"i feel like the updates made the game worse. i installed it on xbox when i got it there after not playing it for years on playstation, it just felt weird, and worse to play. i like how you can create your own custom skins on console though."
6864,that is quite spooky. i'm petrified.
6865,time for the americans to be drafted up.
6866,"and increase the recovery of the shove, not punishable by gb, but make it punishable by most dodge attacks."
6867,most definitely true lol.
6868,"mostly full of assholes you mean. there are some nice, sane people."
6869,"people can complain and stuff sure, (lawbringer does need some nerfs imo) but why even insult a person for who they play, that itself is pretty stupid."
6870,"to be honest, that sounds fun. it's fun getting hate mail. too bad i only get it when playing gladiator"
6871,fair enough. i've only got like 2 reps in lawbringer so i would have never thought the zone could have basically instantaneous recovery and all that. good to know.
6872,400ms? jeez lol. doesn't sound too bad.
6873,haven't seen his zone be used since the dawn of time lol.
6874,raider fair enough. i don't really see how with lawbringer though.
6875,"only ones i can think of is aramusha, bp, zhanhu and kensei, but i don't think that's getting any of them to a tier if they aren't there already."
6876,he's got great zone clearing so that's also another thing going for him.
6877,i think jj too in 4v4 but i'm not entirely sure.
6878,shaman. (not biased at all.)
6879,hur dur! ur mom gay.
6880,"a weeb and a weeaboo are not the same thing. a weeb is what the definition of an anime enthusiast is mostly, where as a weeaboo is what it says already."
6881,"i'm pretty sure you're considered a weeb if you watch anime, even occasionally."
6882,i'm pretty sure it's if you watch anime you're considered a weeb. people just assume that you are instantly a weeb if you're in the samurai as most asian people watch anime and the samurai are basically japanese anyways.
6883,username checks out i guess...
6884,shugoki needs a buff so people can't backroll his mixup. i don't play him for that one reason.
6885,what? is this father a dog or something?
6886,why specifically children's is the real question here.
6887,r/sounding
6888,i don't. the wrath of the lord is inescapable.
6889,sounds like pleasure itself.
6890,yes. can you please bite and bash my balls thanks?
6891,but i am.
6892,"welp cent is coming some time this year. as for the others, it's unknown. i really want aramusha to get a buff as he's like the only samurai i like to play."
6893,"yeah, i saw. 30 to 31 or something like that. it was pretty close. now only if they won more often, then i would probably rejoin them lol."
6894,always the vikings...
6895,i've seen more nuxias as of late depressingly.
6896,imagine playing for honor in 2019. it's a 2020 only game.
6897,that kensei.
6898,"lol, ok then."
6899,"nah. cent's ""buff"" will actually be a nerf unlockable at stage 1073 of the battle pass. do some research next time thanks.

7184,awesome job she looks great.
7185,"i knew this copy pasta would come in handy one day.

so if you were to eat human flesh, would it taste good or bad? just hear me out! taking to really think about what you’re eating is connected to whether or not you’re living a happy life. that’s why i think it’s really important. so there are animals that are carnivores, right? you know, like lions, cats, and vultures. you won’t find meat from carnivores like at a restaurant. why is that? because it’s too smelly to eat! it’s disgusting! listen up, guys! cats are too disgusting to eat. are we on the same page so far? i’d never eat a cat, even if some culinary expert said it was the best thing ever! on the other hand, have you heard of a fish called “sweetfish”? sweetfish don’t eat bugs. they only eat algae. they’re vegetarian. usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat, but sweetfish guts are delicious. it’s because they’re not carnivores. so with that logic in mind, all the meat we consider delicious is from a herbivorous animals! cows, pigs, and chickens! the better their feed, the better they taste! which leads us to this conclusion... humans would taste gross because they eat meat!"
7186,yeah i really enjoyed it
7187,oops sorry

7284,"a nun it's actually a pretty easy costume all you need is a long black skirt,white long sleeved t-shirt,black tank top for the outfit.

and for the headwear you need a black long sleeved t-shirt and a strip of white fabric
you put the white strip around your forehead and the put the black long sleeved t-shirt on your head 

it's sounds crap but it actually works pretty well and everyone gets what it is."
7285,"sure this is one of my favorites:
so this man is walking along a pier and this woman with no arms or legs calls out to him
""i've never been hugged before"" so he hugs her and then he begins to walk of again when she calls to him again ""i've never been kissed before""
feeling sorry for her he kisses her and once again begins walking off when she calls out to him ""i've never been fucked before"" so the man picks her up and throws her into the sea and says ""well you're fucked now"""

7297,i love your username
7298,that's a nice photo
7299,what a cute pumpkin
7300,i do that anyway i just enjoy reading random stuff about peoples day and even if i don't think it's funny or don't care i upvote it any because they shared whatever was on there mind and i should at least appreciate that much.
7301,yeah movies music tv shows i don't really feel guilty either because it's always at the price of having to see porn adds and milfs in my area
7302,hmm cringe but maybe not if you do it a slightly subtle way
7303,"hmm i think maybe tips because although fully dying hair looks nice it doesn't last long, before the roots show especially with dark hair. but with tips it's easier to maintain and i think a bright colour would look lovely on your dark hair, but i'm sure whatever you decide on will look great"

7320,great to hear :-)
7321,sorry i couldn't be more helpful
7322,"there's probably backstreet meat trading and animals are kidnapped killed and eaten.
and law abiding citizens get meat from either natural deaths or maybe it works like organ donation animals donate their bodies for others to eat after they die"
7323,"ok so for snacks stuff like fruit is good just any type you like.

nuts are a good snack as well and popcorn.

as well as carrots i'm not really all that keen on vegetables but carrots are nice because while they taste sweet they have barely any sugar/carbohydrates.

for meals try to include at least one vegetable/fruits.

try new things i thought i was pretty picky but the more different things i tried the more i realized that i liked."
7324,what kind of stuff would you be willing to try?
7325,that's because foxes are omnivores

7333,nice choice i love that book
7334,came her to say the same thing
7335,wrong one
7336,"i loved the anime (because it was one of the first things i watched and hadn't seen much better)
but after reading the manga all the stupid plot holes were explained and it was just so much better."
7337,"i really enjoyed <boku girl>
it's a bit lewd but it's really fun and entertaining and i couldn't put it down i literally binged all in a day it's kind of a romance in a weird way."
7338,i just figured out i can do that too
7339,f-mega
7340,stand users become theives
7341,"that actually reminds me of a story my grandad told me.
this woman used to dry her dog in the oven,
she left the oven door open and it was a very low heat.
she got a microwave and not understanding how it worked she tried to use it to dry her dog.
and ended up cooking her dog"
7342,i'm happy to help :-)
7343,"sure so basically all vegetables are free of carbs, cheese too but it's pretty high in fat.
 popcorn is a good snack as it's low in carbs,
most cereal bars are 10 grams each which is pretty low. all meat is free of carbs as it's protein
also eggs are free and nuts.

(i'm sure you probably knew a lot of this already but that's all i can think of right now)

if there is anything else you want to know feel free to ask."
7344,"as a diabetus i am an expert in the way of carbs
ask away :-)"
7345,which version? frank sinatra or the version from evangelion.

7604,"suppose that you were sitting down at this table. the napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? the one on your ‘left’? or the one on your ‘right’? the one on your left side? or the one on your right side? usually you would take the one on your left side. that is ‘correct’ too. but in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. perhaps i could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘universe’. the correct answer is that ‘it is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …yes? if the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. the same goes for the left. everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. this is ‘society’… who are the ones that determine the price of land first? there must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. the size of the rails on a train track? the magnitude of electricity? laws and regulations? who was the first to determine these things? did we all do it, because this is a republic? or was it arbitrary? no! the one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! the rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! in a society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! in every era, this world has been operating by this napkin principle. and the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. it’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. and those are the ‘losers’. in the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘master of the party’ will take the napkin first… because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals."

8528,why did the chicken cross the road?
8529,your weight is healthy for you. but i'd you lose more weight you will be considered unhealthily skinny
8530,hot

8535,they are both bangers
8536,i have completed my assignment mom
8537,then why say reposts are toxic it's just hypocrisy
8538,literally a repost
8539,nah not insensitive.
8540,smile or you dont get the chiken nuggies
8541,no i dont i dont love my mom i despise her. the thought of her makes me angry. i want to punch myself in the face when i think of her because she is such a shit human
8542,i have been backstabbed
8543,it is your fault you love someone tho. ik its really really hard to stop but you can do it. example my mother is a horrible person and i hate the fact i have lived with her long enough to realize she was a crazy asshole. it was hard but i detached myself from her. i've lived with her my whole life and i believed everything she said for a long time. until i grew enough self respect to stop relying on her.
8544,i dont think this is normal i think this attachment you have to him is not healthy for you. he is in a relationship and hit you.
8545,ye it's a vibe
8546,i have to disagree if you love someone no matter how they hurt you its 100% you fault for staying with them
8547,it's me even though i'm a dude into it ;)
8548,thankyouverymuch
8549,two numba nines with a numba nine large
8550,what did the sky do to you?
8551,i still believe it isnt their business. you can comfort them and all that but i dont think you should even interact with the person who cheated. it's kinda immature to mob mentality onto a dude like that. even if they are a shit head. example if your dad called you and ass and you got hurt feelings you wouldn't call your boyfriend to beat him up or anything (that's an example prolly wouldn't react as bad by just being called an ass).
8552,i think there are too many precautions to prevent us from going into depression. i believe at worst a recession might happen
8553,aight i am appeased
8554,why are you friends with shit people?
8555,aight but violence isnt really an answer
8556,why do you need to be specific? what does it add?
8557,its implied that straight people dont know their stuff and wouldn't peer pressure you into doing that
8558,why did you add they are straight it shouldn't mean anything to the example
8559,you are generalizing straight people and that is not okiedokie. because generalizing people is dumb
8560,candy wrappers by summer salt
8561,nothing it's not your business

8883,if everything you type is random then what's with the person you portray. wouldn't you try to be funnier? because not caring isnt very random

8922,ooof o-o
8923,"finasteride can be safe if you're ready for the challenge. is your mind ready? are you mentally prepared? don't look on propecia help, that shit is a wormhole. just a rule of thumb, if you want to start finasteride you gotta get a hormanal test which includes estrogen, dht, testesterone, free-test, androgen receptors (if possible). these are what fin affects crucially. 

persistent side effects or post-finasteride syndrome occurs when there's an alteration going with your body as it's trying to get back to normal. people say it can cause potential damage to your androgen receptors (rushing dht), or the rebound effect doesn't go as planned. none of these has been proven though.

if you take it, keep caution, and have your doctor monitor you."

8941,"hmmm well i mean tbh ive always wanted to just explore the world and do many cool things. i have lotsss of plans for the summer and crap, yeah. 

i can't think of anything right now that's ""home-made"" but ill try to"
8942,"i completely get you and it sucks if you have trouble trying to balance it. also yeah i have an issue balancing things, i mean i used to study a looot but this month (bc of corona) i told myself to go out there on social media and surprisngly it went wayyyy too well than i expected. i also have issues with online school, its the reason why i dropped out of grade 12 calculus because i simply cant do online courses, my brain just doesnt like it for some reason...

i won't do anything illegal i promise you, i make my judgments before posting/doing anything. and thank you for the last sentence ill be sure to do that :)"
8943,"thank u, but its hard to live now when ur literally trapped in ur own house for the next idk ow many months haha"

8968,loool bruh i have a meme with that exact caption. but yeah that's true lmao glad he shaved that mustache.
8969,thats true even though im a belieber whose stuck in 2013
8970,meanyyy!!! im a true belieber
8971,nope 19 year old guy whose a belieber
8972,idk if this makes matter worse but im a guy
8973,yeah that's what i'm doing in the meantime we are talking again but i suspect it'll be quick
8974,"yeah but all i do is think about her. i get all attidude towards everyone because my crush and i aren't talking. idk when we snap im happy, when we dont (like leaving each other on open), i get sad/mad."
8975,all g bro
8976,"oh shit true thats the best advice but im not sure when to do it like, when she sends a streak do i start a conversation? im sending streaks to all my contacts tonight and i think she'll just leave me on open if i do that"
8977,"oh shit true thats the best advice but im not sure when to do it like, when she sends a streak do i start a conversation? im sending streaks to all my contacts tonight and i think she'll just leave me on open if i do that"
8978,might as well shave both of them now
8979,happy 19th bro
8980,how is that ugly
8981,thank you
8982,that's a legit excuse i'm guessing since ur a shift manager ?
8983,youll prob find no one lmao
8984,"i learned it's always best to do things young because of you make a mistake no one is gonna make fun of you for it. even at our age of course. that's why i want to experience a lot of things just for the experience and young memories. don't let your anxiety get in the away (i have major anxiety), just say to urself , your doing this for no one except you. you. that helps me at least. you gotta train your mind to think differentlly which is hard of course..but naturally i think you'll get the hang of it"
8985,"ah, id do anything to be 16 again but with my current brain. idk it seems when i was that age i really didn't do much as i'd like to, always rejected new oppturtunities and such. but i guess im saying that now bc i got wiser and more curious of the world. i want experience of everything in this world (x"
8986,"ah, id do anything to be 16 again but with my current brain. idk it seems when i was that age i really didn't do much as i'd like to, always rejected new oppturtunities and such. but i guess im saying that now bc i got wiser and more curious of the world. i want experience of everything in this world (x"
8987,"haha trueee,, im never deleting my old reddit posts its pure memories ( i rlly dont think anyone should). i'll look back on it in 3 or 4 years and see how young and naieve i was :d time flies really fast though. one momenr your 16 then boom 19. 

i often dreamt of becoming a father at 19 and having a kid  (dont worry just a fantasy xd) so that when they complain ill be able to relate since i was a kid not long ago and i wont feel like a boomer haha

but yeah 19 was a very very interesting year. lots of good and bad. i learned a lot. i say 19 for me at least is the worst but also best age to be. 18 for me was 17, still in hs so i felt nothing."
8988,"aw thanks, guess i should change my way of thinking. also, i live in canada (ottawa). we used to have a good amusement park but that was back in 2010 i think."
8989,ohh thank u! yeah it messed up my plans majorily but lets hope it gets all better. best of luck!
8990,"yeah, but idk, it's like making the best of your ""teen"" years because tbh this is the only age where i actaully did shit and made memories. 16 was also another prime year but eh. that's it. just 16 and 19. also, i get 19 and 20 are literally right next to each other but if you do dumb things at 19 your forgiven because your still a teen but at 20 you'll be looked down upon..not sure if that's true or not. also its ok to be immature at 20, its not like ur 30 lol. 

nope, we have 0 amusement parks at my city, but i knew a few outside of my city, so that's why i want to go there. may-june is when it gets hot here so im begging to god this thing is over (at least in my province in may)"
8991,"ahh similar to you, i have a 25 year old sister, and a 23 year old sis. as well a 14 year old bro. i can't relate to any of them tbh. my older sis always mocks me whenver i experiment with things like jewerly and shit which i think is normal for our age or not..idk. i just like trying new things and see what looks good. i'll be straight up though, i'm pretty immature for my age but i'm hoping life exeriences will change that soon. really sucks though i had such good plans for the summer such as;

biking, escape rooms, drag racing, amusement parks, rock climbing, swimming, strolling downtown, all these plus many more and if covid-19 ruins it idk what ill freaking do. i want all these completed before i turn 20. i want the best for my age."
8992,ahh yeah basically same lol. do you have any older siblings? or younger ones?
8993,in between. allot of the /youngadults post i relate to. 17-20 are the gap i relate to i guess lol
8994,"that last sentence tho (insert laughing crying emojis) fuck that was so straight up haha

but yeah i wish my birthday was in december 31 so i can have more time xd but oh well. 20 from what i heard is a continuation of 19/teenager and 21 is when you're really an adult. idk. 18-20 is considered an adolencsence by definition so."
8995,"all the way in july 11. i told myself when i turned 20 (when i was a fresh 19 year old), ill still be active on r/teenagers because i really dont see a diffrence between 19 and 20 mentally. but now, after experiencing so many most people don't experience at my age. i think it'll be time to move to r/youngadults. it's crazy how the mind/brain can devolope from 19 to 20. 

honestly ill prob see r/teenagers time to time for the memes. but that's it."
8996,"ah that make sense too. guess we each have different taste buds on how we like the subs. i like more people, you like smaller communities. makes sense. i was 17 when i first joined,and tbh i really loved it, people helped me so much with my crush problems and shit. now at 19 yeah im still technically a teen, but some of the posts i find cringey now (which i didnt find 2 years ago), so yeah.

there's also plenty of 18-19 year olds lurking r/teenagers, i met tons of amazing older teens here. but i guess we each have different taste buds."
8997,goodluck :)
8998,"i'll just post it here since i'm over it.

i have social anxiety/used to have obsessive thoughts/depression

it all started with my looks: no girls would talk to me because i believed i was just ugly af. because of this i devoloped body dysmorphia which is a mental health disorder where your afraid of your own shadow. you constantly avoid mirrors/cameras because you believe your repulsive. so i forgot what i looked like for two years. at 19 it just became worse and worse. i started to have crushes which the first one failed. i overthank constantly on the what ""ifs"". my post history says a lot. i had hairloss too which fucked with my mind because there's a drug that treats with hairloss called finasteride but this drug has the ability to make you infertile/cause sexual side effects/cause man boobs. these side effects sometimes persists. that's a condition called post-finasteride syndrome. this literally destroyed me. people called me a hyperchondriac, because i was too obsessed with the side effects even though they happen rarely. i had to make a choice, hair or my sex life. this ultimatly led me to attempt suicide. i was already failing university and i had a major crush on a girl in which she rejected me. so i had nothing to live for. i was in the hospital and eventually released. it was really bad. i started to watch high school shooting videos to make myself feel better. i was really abusive and edgy. everything is going downhill. it wasn't pretty. doctors thought i was going crazy because they kept on telling me i was overthinking. at the time i was dealing with vision problems and prostate pain. it was all caused by stress (no surprise aye?). after all of this i posted something really dark on social media, and the police came and brought me to the hospital. i was there for three days and i saw a prisoner and he was so fucking scary. i realized at that point my life could be better than this. i can be out there enjoying my life. fuck girls. i can't be stuck here. i'm so glad i wasn't too late to fix this. imagine i was there for a year or something. this made me chuckle, i remember asking the police if i could listen to music in the car. they said yes. after i was discharged i was a free man. i lost my bestfriend but i didnt let that stop me. i had to get my shit together. so i did. honestly i didnt get any therapy. i focused on my mental health and physical health. my brain now doesn't recognize depression or suicidal thoughts. i no longer watch high school shooting videos. i don't do any of that stupid shit. i was a dumb naieve, 19 year old who was clearly struggling and had no alternatives. or so i thought. my friends reassured me looks arent everything and life is more meaningful than just looks.

now to this day, my social life is great. i have tons of friends, i'm posting more pictues of my face which is something i havent done in 3 years. i'm so much better physically and mentally. hell i got my libido back! (sex drive). i get shit tons of requests from girls now. everything is going amazing. i don't believe this was a phase i was going through. but i just needed help but i was too scared to get help. with the addition of that, i overcame my social anxiety and i just live up to my life with my great personality. i'm getting jaw surgery next year to fix my breathing issues. i just need patience."
8999,my grades dropped because of this too. teenage girls (esp 13-15) are just fucking annoying to deal with. it's just a teen experience you had really. it'll get better in ur upper teens
9000,"oh shit, that sounds like me. do you want my experience? (beware might be long)"
9001,ikr but big facts haha
9002,sounds like me on a daily basis
9003,"lmao depends on what type. there's 100 different kinds, what are you leaning more specifically?"
9004,i mean..they can't touch you legally cuz they might have corona :o if they do you can file a lawsuit and you get rich
9005,i mean..they can't touch you legally cuz they might have corona :o if they do you can file a lawsuit and you get rich
9006,imagine i attract corona instead of girls. guess she'll be in bed with me xx
9007,run run run
9008,np
9009,oh loool
9010,hot bro
9011,ya im a cute candy cane. thx
9012,"honestly like, r/teenagers bc it's just more active and i can get relationship advice faster and some of the stuff there is funny ngl. but i'm trying to lean more towards /youngadults because it's more for me in the future (and even right now). i just wish more people would join here, maybe then i can leave r/teenagers for good."
9013,damn smexy
9014,shutup haha im a edgy 19 year old lelelele
9015,why would you send an elephant emoji lmfao
9016,uh the eggplant one
9017,how is that discrimination. dumb 15y/o girls
9018,honstly i wish i knew lmao
9019,lots and lots of shit posts and reposts of memes. but if you go to /new there's actually some good reltable posts.
9020,yeah actually haha. i'm still kinda active there. it's been a off/on switch for me. i only recently started to be active there again bc here its kinda dead. from december-feb i was barely active there though.
9021,wtaf
9022,"ah i see. i remember doing really really stupidthings at 16 years. at 19 i do stupid, but not ""really"" stupid if you know what i mean"
9023,guess im still a stupid 19 year old teen :/
9024,ur making me feel old even tho im a year younger than u lmao
9025,thank you <3
9026,"19 and same. maybe 21 will hit you. i think 18-21 is when we get with ""mental puberty"" since your brain is devoloping really fast until we turn 25."
9027,damn wtf
9028,damn they turned the tables around! we were ahead first..
9029,same with u bro
9030,"yeah im 19 years and i literally look like a high schooler. i like it, but im curious when that'lll change.."
9031,i mean im 19 and look 16 so.
9032,oof me 19
9033,damm
9034,because libido is more formal lol. i thought everyone knew that
9035,sex drive lol
9036,sex drive
9037,thanks
9038,"thanks :) i wish even online classes was suspended bc what can you do if your sick? i dont wanna drag a long convo outta this since my opinion is unpopular bc everyone who will be graduating will be shanked and osap would have to refund everyone. so eh. i'm doing much better, my breathing is like 95% back to normal. im not sure if tyneol worked or not but ill have another dose."
9039,what does hst mean
9040,damn yeah i wish i was like you lol i can't even do that. i had a lab today but i didn't do anything because i was making sure my mental and physical health was ok because i had a hard time breathing like i was actually scared shitless. i'm still not sure what caused it but i suspect it's due to paranoia or fear bc i was watching the news allot and decided to watch contagion
9041,"i am definately fucked lol. and i'm doing better now i guess. i really didn't expect that to happen to me, and it was incredibly scary i thought i was going to die , but i just calmed myself down with the help of my parents. anywyas, isolation sucks but what can we do lol."
9042,"ya im sick (i had a panic attack for the first time at like 4am). took the time to focus on my mental and physical health, then i realized i had a lab to do which i didnt. like fuck sake i just wish we can all get a refund and start school in september. really hate doing online school when im sick, profs take forever to repond, and focusing the well beings of my loved ones.

at this point i dont really care if i fail biology lol. math ill try but what can you do when your sick??"
9043,"dunno what to say, it fucked like most of us over. but goodluck :p"
9044,your lucky. i woke up to a panic attack and my breathing has gone to shit. i can't really focus on anything but making sure i'm self isolating and taking tylenol and my parents making sure i'm good. brutal but it all happened after watching contagion but i don't remember being scared from it.
9045,holy shit i'm so sorry for your lost one wtf imms pray for you and your loved ones. today hasn't been good for me. i woke up with a panic attack and ever since my breathing has gone to shit. like rn it's improving but man i was breathing so heavily and this happened after i watched the movie contagion so it felt like i was in a movie. it's weird. but obviously i'm never going outside rn and hopefully my breathing goes back to normal
9046,ok lol
9047,you realize  how dumb your comment sounds
9048,lmao wtf
9049,interview during a pandemic? goodluck
9050,thank you. yeah i'm trynna fix my sleeping habits it's really bad rn. and i'm just incredibly tired despite sleeping. thank you and it's hard because my parents always blast the news and whatnot
9051,keep at it buddy. i'm hoping this ends real soon
9052,ikrrr
9053,ya i think most people don't go in depth of his past. i did so i know wats up.
9054,"ohhh i see, respect for that"
9055,thanks lmao i needed that
9056,right now they both changed completely. i think selena for the worst. she keeps on saying how he abused her for empathy even tho we already knows he did. justin admitted it yet she keeps saying it on and on.
9057,yeah ill give it a shot. currently im on a justin bieber/selena/kesha phase but ill make sure to listen to that xd
9058,no way. they are a perfect match. justin was just young and reckless because of all that fame and money. if he had the maturity to control his finances then i gaurantee he'd be married to selena and didn't abuse his relationships due to drug abuse. he knew selena since he was 14?? and dated all the way to 21? that's a prolong and significant dating gap.
9059,ahh thats nice. guess im more of a pop dude
9060,ahh thats nice. guess im more of a pop dude
9061,"shes annoying now, but i liked her a lot back then"
9062,"yeah im thinking now why i included that lol. anyways tho, im guessing you aren't a justin bieber/selena gomez fan?"
9063,ahh so im guessing you were never a justin/selena fan?
9064,complete opposite for me. how the fuck can i beat my meat when everyones in the house and constantly around me.
9065,same. except i didnt start shit yet.
9066,dying currently lmao
9067,literally still the same. though my junk intake has increased.
9068,you should ask this question in like a month or 2 lol
9069,ehh i guess it depends on the persons experience but i do agree majority cases it's kinda shit
9070,tf is a bed head
9071,bruh
9072,😳😳
9073,"haha same not to mention i share rooms with my brother and he's 14 and he blasts his songs or plays games and rages while i'm trying to study..

arab families are just loud in general tbh lmao"
9074,will do haha
9075,"this is a misconception. although it is true in many location it really depends. i got incredibly lucky to be in a location with amazing people. my store manager is literally my favourite and i'm friends with his son that's in grade 11. he provided me so many support when i was dealing with my mental health crisis back then. the friends and support i've made there is intense. i never knew out of all places mcdonslds would be the one that can provide me this. that's why i miss it. i also miss the annoying customers because now all dining room is closed and it feels so weird going into mcdonald's seeing everything closed, and many hours being cut."
9076,same man same :(
9077,thanks so much for all the advice. sadly though my parents literally blast the tv out loud and all they watch is the covid-19 updates and such. and i ofc i get curious and watch it with them. even with breakfast the tv is on.
9078,omgg i can't wait to tell my future kids or anyone when im older of my university experience - espicially first year!! it's crazy when you think about it. and aw im glad i put a smile! thank you sm!!!
9079,no problem bro i got u :)
9080,"for me because shes just really chill. i dunno, when i first met her i tried to impress her but i failed. later on though, she started to laugh at my jokes and now we call each other insults (as jokes of course). so our humour and personality just blew it. plus shes really cute imo. she's my third crush but my first crush of 2020. it's crazy. we progressed so much the past 2 months and now it's on hold bc of the stupid virus. this month i just realized we texted more than ever. 
ooof"
9081,"i think you got this. even not, i dont think you should mourn over it 24/7. there are people here who don't event talk to girls but they are happy. i wish i can do that lool, but oh well. also just curious, why do you like her? maybe we can share our reaosns why. its 1am and im bored lol."
9082,"ah, thank you so much for this. like really, it put a huge smile on my face. i'm glad there are awesome people like you here. much respect to you and i'll gladly follow your advice. stay safe brother!! :))

edit: yeah, my first year is kinda all over the place haha, but i guess it's an experience ill never forget!"
9083,"yeah i feel you. same with me, but she said she has her eyes on someone which isn't me for a fact. but hey at least she notices me and knows i exist. we're pretty close too at work which is a huge bonus. maybe that's why she replied to my story. 

don't force anything. just let everything go naturally like you said and hope for the best, for the both of us"
9084,"if u got any updates tell me, or if you want to vent. i'm here for you, for bothh. i'd like to see another being happy (if it all goes well for me loool cuz ill be end up being jealous of you :p )"
9085,the toilet paper meme is gonna be the meme of the year. nothing will beat that haha.
9086,haha i mean it's fine for now. it's still cold outside so there's literally nothing to do.
9087,"i had the whole ""march break"" but still didn't do anything. so same. only motivation ill get is if summer school is face to face or cases begin to decline."
9088,omg haha same. but i got used to it pretty quickly
9089,lol ironically my sleep went to shit. i mean i wake up late so i get enough hours but i sleep at 1-2am now.
9090,no worries. anything over 20 is bad though. i left her on delivered for 4 hours b4 bc i was busy. longest was 11 hours. you should be fine
9091,"exactly this, im just overwhelmed with emotions of the people i cant see, studying for stupid shit i don't care about currently, and worrying about a lot of things. i just gave up on school, i just want my friends and family safe... my dad is kinda sick and i have to always make sure no one goes outside (the vunerable). sucks i dont have my license yet at 19 so i feel useless."
9092,ya and now we're supposedly doing streaks. so i guess naturally it went well lol. thank you though for helping me
9093,same lmao. i'm left on delivered for 11minutes and i have no idea what's going to happen tmwr. but tbh i didnt expect her to respond to that.
9094,maybe theyll send one tmwr since i started the streak? thats my hypothesis at least lmao also shes my crush so even a bonus she replied to my story
9095,"man i wasted a whole two weeks of doing absolately nothing knowing im probably gonna fail biology.

this year (my first year)  was really..interesting i should say. from the hospital to compelte isolation."
9096,just an update she replied to one of my stories just now oh dear
9097,thank god im not alone
9098,thank you ill just post it since everyone knows by now ive done last time lmao but idk like people know my condition so there's my excuse but i dont wanna be that guy who posts all his selfies with the same filter
9099,he was 18-19
9100,19 isn't grown lmao
9101,"damn.. here in canada it's not that bad. at least in my city. quebec as of today closed all their malls and basically everything until may 1 at least. in ontario everything is still the same, you can go outside but things have changed the past week. for public transporation u can no longer enter using the front door, only the middle/back door. schools are all closed except it's online (for unis only). for work (i work at mcd) all dining room is closed until further notice so it's only drive thru that's open 24/7. 

it delayed all of my favorite things. such as going to the cinema, going outside, just living my life.. :p"
9102,"i have online school that i didnt do shit for , for 2 weeks now. i just opened it up and i have so much work including a test...and im in first year uni

ok sorry for the rant. hi, hows the whole covid going on in ur country?"
9103,she said she has her eyes on a guy though which isn't me
9104,h o t
9105,well fuck
9106,you got snap?? we can talk there if ya want lmao i'm a bored bitch too rn
9107,19 m if ya wanna talk go for it i'm literally bored asf from this virus lmao
9108,you got snap ?
9109,i'm 19m if ya wanna chat go for it i'm bored asf from this whole covid 19
9110,"i'm suspecting late april or may. if we listen by self isolating then we can put an end to this once and for all. the virus needs a host, without a host itll die so if we listen by self isolating or staying extremely cautious then we can end this."
9111,lol rip
9112,why would a 7 year old use tik tok
9113,sure lol
9114,what he say
9115,not really
9116,">13

fuck no"
9117,d e e p
9118,"surgery is just a upper jaw expander i was excited cuz like it'll be a nice transformation for me but now i have to wait 

as for the crush oh well lol, it sucks, like i'd rather see her irl since we can acc feel our emotions and idk like goof off if  u know what i mean

although face timing or calling is kinda similar since u can hear them but i'm too scared for that lmao we don't text a lot or hangout but we do have some memorable and good memories we've saved."
9119,"same texting isn't the same compared to irl since you can acc feel their emotions and goof off. it's even worse in text if they are a dry tester or they just suck at it

edit: ya i want this shit to end fast"
9120,but how irl if everyone's legit forced to self isolate
9121,lol ikrr at work we call each other kinds of animals and i've known her for 3 months and already we have lots of funny abd embarrassing memories. but this fucking virus just ruined it all. hopefully i'll still see her
9122,"jesus two years while me i post everyday but tbh i only
do it so that when i'm older i can look back into my life"
9123,true i wish i had that talent of getting more friends but 99% cases they are hot so it's easy for them
9124,hbu
9125,but how she gets them is the question haha
9126,"it's also like youtube. recording and broadcasting your life, i guess for each person we use it differently. i use it for memes, videos, weird videos, snaps, etc etc"
9127,"well i know for a fact she'll respokd but what if she sounds disinterested? at work i'll feel so awkward aroind her cuz of that. or what if she does leave me on read ? idk

but to also say, our convo that we had for five days straight it was all in caps for example ""lmaoo your a dumbass"" and i said ""your a cowww"" and she said ""well ur a donkey"" so i guess we have chemistry 

but i left her on read after she sent me two laughing emojis after she asked me ""hows being grounded bitch"" and yeah haven't heard from her since and it's been two days. 
also don't judge our texting style haha 

i'll just stick to the replying to stories method. i sometimes reply and she does too. i was surprised it lasted 5 days while on average it took like 4 texts for the convo to end"
9128,i wish man :( only filters make me look actually above average i guess 😂
9129,ohh yeah everything you said is true sometimes it is hard to maintain streaks since i killed some of them due to forgetting or i wasn't on a lot. the only thing i like about snap than insta or others is that it feels your more secure and safe with private stories and it's so easy to record whatever is happening with a click of a button and post. streaks is just the fun of snap and it's like a game for me. filters is just something i'm experimenting and it's funny haha. bitemoji are also cool and a girl is more likely to say yes to ask for her snapchat than number or something. that's just my view and experience. maybe you should give it another try.
9130,lmao legit i just added bunch of peeps so like well imma expect that
9131,i failed the first step haha
9132,jc what was ur reason of leaving ? i've had it for a year and so far it's great since your on ur own pace so u don't have to worry about clout or people checking how many friends u have etc except the lag is so annoying there
9133,"ahh i see just curious does view count serve a purpose like it increases your snap score or is it just for clout or popularity ?

edit view count"
9134,"should i add people from quick add? i feel like i'll get bunch of comments like ""who are you "" etc"
9135,i was just wondering cuz damn hell thats allot
9136,but to me that sounds crazy lmao
9137,honestly true
9138,ohhhh😂also can u check my most recent post i have a question loool
9139,ah do you have a personal fav to reccomend ? ya boiii is new
9140,omg sameee the most i've had with this girl was we were talking 5 days straight (not non stop tho) and i guess after i left her on read (because she replied with a laughing emoji and idk how to respond to that) i kinda became dependant on her and i miss it and i just have to hope she'll reply to one of my stories (literally all of our conversations she or i replied to her stories) but how do i like ..not kill myself over this ?(not literally) like every time if something doesn't go my way i just get a dreaded feeling it really sucks
9141,"i just made it and i'm on the home page but the ones i'm seeing is just cringey some are funny but idk, which ones are addicting or funny?"
9142,"all my friends have it so i'm just like fuck it 

body dysmorphia is a mental health condition where your basically thinking ur ugly af 24/7 and avoid mirrors  cameras etc etc 24/7 i'm trying to treat my condition in fact i posted a selfie with a filter on snap oooof"
9143,"but how if that's the majority she texts ? i'm on her private story and she posts stuff like of her friends with captions that make me jealous lol like ""glad we are close"" etc etc yikes i guess i caught a case of jealously"
9144,she had a yolo the other day with lots of people hitting her up and stuff and she's kinda popular 😂
9145,i can't lol she has so many people hitting her up and their all hot while i'm not so rip
9146,or me
9147,ah i see thanks my face shape looked better in the filter so i guess that bumped me up
9148,"fuck thanks so much for this i needed to hear this sadly gorls our ages or around my age still go by looks. reality is hot girls or thots always go after the hot dudes like they say on their yolo to say anything and the guys on it and the girl is like ""ur hot sb"" i just wish those girls gives me a chance but whatever 

also a question: does a snapchat filter (one that gives you clear skin) change your facial features or does it just change ur skin? kinda been wondering i don't want to mislead ppl"
9149,thanks my man. tbh i also realized my looks will tend to fade later on so like ..might as well start to post crappy selfies before you get all old and wrinkly haha and good for u!
9150,thank you alooot for this. are you a guy too ?? legit body dysmorphia is a condition i have and it sucks butt! but i'm treating it by being comfortable with myself. wow ! i just posted a selfie which was a normal one only my skin was cleared up and everyone was surprise and not one (so far) said i was ugly quiet the opposite so this is a good feeling to have :)
9151,"i see thanks i guess but i have experience with this stuff like that. even though what you wrote was meaningful and whatnot, that didn't really answer my question meh. but oh well lol thank you glad you could help me out"
9152,thanks :) so i'm not that ugly ?
9153,"hey your honest so that's better hopefully i'm not a 4/10 tho

let's say i post this would you think girls would be like ""eww"" even tho they already know what i look like ? or"
9154,i don't wanan go too far lmao
9155,go on my most recent post...it's a poster but you get the glimpse of me haha
9156,"i mean everyone uses filters i guess,, but then again my friends don't. i'm so fucked."

9199,like 30 minutes ago
9200,well she asked me in caps how's being grounded bitch i started to vent with emojis and she replied with two laughing emojis but i didn't know how to respond so i left it like that lol i guess now i'm realizing i should've responded ? but it's too late now
9201,"haha nope jkjk i did. 
i just realize she was mocking me cuz im grounded (yes at 19) and she asked jokingly hows being grounded and i was like venting and she sent two laughing emojis. should have i replied to that? or did i do the right thing and not respond?"
9202,nahh its not stupid haha. i just wish i had the surgery at like feburary so i can hv march and april to chill. guess not! god damn.
9203,"and i really thought 2020 was gonna be my year xd
i mean it was so far...until the virus came along and now it ruined pretty much eveythin"
9204,lol bullshit
9205,fuck
9206,i'm predicting hundreds to maybe 1000 cases here. since symtons range to show up they are gonna be touching things and others and then they are gonna do the same and it's gonna be an endless cycle.
9207,"im a simple man.  i see dicc, i go sucky sucky

*no homo tho*"
9209,madman thinking ahead o-o
9210,suck my dickcc
9211,"yeah your nose will change and your cheekbones. i'm pretty sure it depends on how many mm hes gonna move it up but i think it's going to move despite the amount of mm moved.

the whole point of doing this is to get the face your *supposes* to get when you went through puberty since your poor habits caused complications"
9212,"yeah my surgeon hasn't called me yet but hopefully im wrong, thanks tho! and hope u recover well :)"
9213,"that really sucks but it also sucks for us, i mean my surgery might get postponsed or something. i really was hyped and wanted it done in may but idk what's gonna happen now"
9214,i was 1 second late and still got penalised lmao
9215,"im apart time at carleton, from what ilearned i think u gotta apply for osap again but for part time instead of part time."
9216,woahhh the last pic where it showed your x-ray that's crazy! i really like the technology of todays century. i wonder what it's gonna look like in the year 3000??? will it be the same? will it just be a snap of a second and boom? will it be professional robots who have a 0% complication rate?
9217,"i don't know what to say to help but 3 things man..

1. the most important out of all: stay away from propecia help. once you're in, you're never getting out. it took me so long to escape that hell-hole.

2. consult an endo asap and get a hormone test. make sure you get your testesterone levels tested, free-test levels, estrogen, dht, i might be missing one more but those seem to be the main one. i'm not sure if you can get your androgen receptors tested. if you can, do it.

3. meantime, take zinc as it increases libido and helps halt sexual problems your experiencing and do no-fap. 

best of luck."
9218,think ill like that mm
9219,"they haven't eaten me yet!
source: been fuckin' them since 18"
9220,lol
9221,ive been fucking goats since 18 darn
9222,so a pillow basicallyyy??? heaven at last!
9223,"i haven't watched 13 reasons why but i think its getting a lot of hate bc it encourages suicide or self harm?? idk. i never really liked the show anyways. 

stranger things is where it's atttt. i watched the show in the summer and it was literally the best show i've ever watched."
9224,tbh i like round soft boobssss
9225,our mcdonalds is doing the same. front lobby is open but they gotta go once they get their food. we have to wash our hands every hour or between changing stations. it wont be fair for the new crew or those who only do fc to compltely shut it off since how else do they make their income or make quick cash?
9226,but i dont get how a year suddenly changes everything. but i have noticed def my libido decreased over the year.
9227,20 and 31??? yikes
9228,i was going to try finasteride which is a hairloss drug but i backed down eventually. for that you need a sperm count test since it affects your fertility. my dad's was very very low but managed to get my mom to concieve. i think the same is happening to me :(
9229,i started watching anime in 2016 and bleach was my first pick and i havent regretted it. best anime imo. im soo happy for it to come back i wanna see grimmjow!!
9230,yay
9231,y'all living in december 2019? everything's in lockdown convid-19 is here
9232,deadass
9233,i tired to put the infinity symbol 😂
9234,"remember sin, e^x and all polynomials have no domain restriction. thus the domain would be all real numbers or (-oo,oo)."
9235,i think it's cuz of the covid-19
9236,i mean he has his new album at the worst time but even before that it wasn't selling well which is so sad. but i'm stuck in 2013 since i'm still listening to his old songs
9237,"kinda what i expected now 

seems i'm still in 2013 lmao"
9238,this is extremely helpful i read everything! thanks so much for taking your time to write this. i'm gaining so much more new knowledge of this topic. thank you :)
9239,omg this is so eye opening and very useful and amazing information. thank you so much i understand this much better!
9240,"man i need this prof for whatever subject next year, he seems hella funny"
9241,thank you:)
9242,"ohh okay, i was confused on how he was created. he was a jinn who can make mistakes and sin while angels cant. so even though satan was one of god's favorites, he casted him away for being disobedient to god. makes sense now."
9243,"oh okay, but i read in the quran (if i recall correctly) that allah loved him regardless of his status so that wouldn't really change much if his love for god was still greater."
9244,"""some"""
9245,fake as fuck
9246,it's the side effects and how it decreases neursteroids in the brain that makes me not wanna try it
9247,this is too precious
9248,"i read it but like, i read the studies too and thought to myself am i just constantly wasting money for something that's probably not gonna work? i have to pay for my braces and jaw surgery and school. 

i live in canada and oral minoxidil is just asking for heart side effects; even on low doses i still don't trust that crap espicially if oral is not fda approved.

for the showering, i used to shower every 2-3 days because to save water and whatnot but now, im being more concious about my body thus i wash myself everyday."
9249,meh it can go in-between tbh.
9250,more like 5%
9251,ngl it's bad man and your face looks slightly chubby
9252,ah i honestly wish i can relive 12 with the current brain i have. that would be so nice and shit. i miss the old days :(
9253,"i remember those youtube videos where the two girls started making out the ending was always something like ""click the description for the full video"" or something but i was always scared to click it my god i was so innocent. worst part this was happening in the family computer since we only had one computer at the time and it was located in my parents bedroom. i can't believe how many bullets i dodged thinking back."
9254,"at 12 i was looking up ""2 girls kissing"" on youtube haha since i never knew pornhub existed then later on nature took its course"
9255,true lmao
9256,beginning** sadly
9257,damn at 19? i started at like 16-17
9258,still a teen but denied entrance to a strip club smh
9259,it's all good now but thanks!
9260,i'm like almost 100% it's not tmwr. i checked culearn and he wrote a long paragraph explaining what he'll do (which is moving the lectures online later) but never mentioned the test. i'll continue checking my email the morning of.
9261,yay more days to study !
9262,who will even remember oc transpo anymore?! that's old news now!
9263,ikr!
9264,thank you i will:)
9265,yes
9266,ya i dropped it when i had it with alyssa it was terrible
9267,frrr😂😂😂 this shit is crazy
9268,dumbass
9269,hothotohototoototototottot
9270,ohh ok thanks!
9271,would you say it was only a phase?
9272,so it was most definately a phase for you? ah
9273,yeah ive seen that haha imagine seeing a 35 year old who still needs their parents for shit lmao.
9274,"just curious, what does 99u mean?"
9275,deeply sorry for the tragic loss of this fellow student.
9276,ya
9277,true thanks tho
9278,i didn't wanna get too personal with her or make her feel uncomfortable so that's why
9279,not regularly but we do reply to each other stories time to time and we both get along really well at work.
9280,ah thanks idk why i overthink this
9281,oops
9282,"""thanks that means a lot "" etc etc lol but it'll do"
9283,two ppl under 18 got it so
9284,what did he say
9285,"19m here, i gotchu just hmu anytime"
9286,same the second test was kinda brutal ..what's going to happen to the test on monday since it's cancelled??
9287,it just feels way too early to end it all fuck :(
9288,same
9289,same :( i hope they dont offer only online classes for the summer :p
9290,"that truly sucks man...i hope everything goes back to normal soon but realistically and sadly this is just the beginning of the virus...i hope they could re-schedule the graduation? idk.

im gonna miss waking up almost late and texting my friends if they are going to class or not. ugh."
9291,we are starting wednesday not monday
9292,same with my bio labs lmao
9293,hell yes i had a test monday which i wasn't prepared for so wohoooo
9294,yeah i'm a freshman and wanted first year to be pretty awesome. but i'm taking summer classes so i guess i still have more time
9295,face to face is what i always prefer though
9296,ah nvm it works it's just slow and glitchy for me weird but thanks lol
9297,also it's on the news that snap is down worldwide yesterday and today
9298,really? if you go on twitter supprt everyone's spamming them saying it won't let them post stories and shit so idk
9299,keep in mind i'm not an expert but this is utterly false (i think??). hand sanatizers don't kill viruses it only kills bacteria so it won't really help you at all. best thing is to just wash your hands whenever you can
9300,ok
9301,hope she recovers from it.
9302,yes
9303,there should be another black friday but only toilet paper is on sale. let's just see what happens.
9304,you look like ur about to kill me lmao
9305,i legitimately failed both midterms....so i'm literally fucked
9306,big hassle for me. didn't think it was worth it. might retry for the third time tho since i changed some of my habits that can probably compensate some of the hassle
9307,ur hot loool. how old are you?
9308,get ur parents to see an oral surgeon so you can start planning. mewing is bullshit unless you can actually breathe through your nose. if you cant then it's your jaw thats the problem.
9309,same lol. i've used it at 19 but quit recently (still 19)
9310,"post-finasteride syndrome is a real thing, just saying"
9311,"off topic but i laughed when it said 

""best regards,

  guy"""
9312,i love green tea
9313,i agree!
9314,"same lmao except for handling one course at a time. i need to be in class to function, but then again im tired like 24/7 even though i sleep well"
9315,i hate online lectures lol i dropped grade 12 calculus online bc it was that bad i myself can't do online classes i get distracted way too easily
9316,same lmao
9317,ahh okay i see. thank you
9318,wait i never did a take home exam. do they give you a physical copy or is it online? and is it monitored? crap now i'm thinking this will be a bad idea. i'm scared how it's gonna be for math and biology ...
9319,take home sounds amazing
9320,certainly part of me wants the same outcome as the public schools because i just want to relax but then again we already handed our money to the unis so we'll be wasting money if we suspend everything unless we get a refund or something.
9321,yeah same lol i have a lab in two weeks for bio
9322,"ok nvm now it's just glitchy af. i went on the app but i can't find an update button it just says ""open"" . how do you find the update button?"
9323,it should work now. it's working for me
9324,there's a bug i think. i contacted them and said they are looking into it.
9325,i contacted them and they are currently fixing it. lots of ppl are experiencing this so dw
9326,why is this downvoted it's true
9327,how much mg u got?
9328,doesnt fin increase t tho?
9329,guess it fucked with my libido but zinc is a god supplement haha;)
9330,"yeah it's really brtual ..:p 
thanks a lot though, after the midterm i'll re-evaulate myself and start to seek options/solutions even professional help if i need it.

helped. thanks"
9331,yeah i really need to get kicked in the ass that this isnt high school lol. i'm paying loads for my education and im here for a purpose. im just really down right now after this realization. i made a lot of mistakes and i guess im learning my lesson from it. slacking is my worst enemy yet is my best friend. it sucks a lot.
9332,soo did u do it
9333,"i always research profs before picking haha, it's a good habit of mines i guess lol"
9334,eyeyye
9335,this is what i agree with. for the mean time just temporarily make all the 200 series express routes go straight to downtown. we don't need that extra transfer.
9336,*touches you*
9337,"it's just funny and it's more accepting as well as humurous. im 19 and sometimes to my friends im like ""your hot bitch"" or ""your cute big homo"" and we laugh it off. even people around me find it funny lmao. if girls can do that shit then why can't we?"
9338,"that fucking iphone alarm clock i have to wake up to every morning. when i hear it outside (for school activities for example; using a stopwatch) i just wanna break that phone lmao.

guess i just hate that alarm noise"
9339,19
9340,ohh it was just a side thing i don't mind. calculus average was very very low for us. not sure about linear tho
9341,"lol i'll say it again, bring back the old buses. that's it. i've been saying this since october 6. eventually they will listen to me"
9342,thanks!
9343,sorry if i sound like i'm bragging but i'm shit at math usually get 60s in hs and stuff. i just find it weird lol
9344,need to know this too as i might take this in the summer
9345,lmao no. social media is just fear mongering people. the flu alone kills half a million and the fatality rate for this is only 2-3% plus it usually kills those over 40. so no it hasn't affected me at all
9346,"well i'm in math1107 and really i never write dates but i go by chapters. the test next week (if you have mark) is based on the handbook (which you may or may not bought in the beginning of the year) in which is based on determinants, eigenvectors and values, and diagnolization. i think that's how far we r gonna end up. so just study the handbook do homework and watch youtube and you get a easy 90, thatd what i do at least and the example problems and tutorials are very similar to the test questions"
9347,"ah you again. won't really argue how you found this post once again. but anyways, well one thing, they are only 3 years younger which sounds common, they are legal too although that isn't my purpose (just weird to talk to a 15 year old knowing she isn't legal) etc etc"
9348,breezula is our only hope lol
9349,u look about 24
9350,"honestly, i was expecting an ugly girl from this post and comments. (so much sugar coaters here). but, you're actually wrong! 

sis, you're actually attractive, 7/10 for me."
9351,good bro 6/10
9352,i know it's a disgrace.
9353,the most accurate rating imo
9354,"big nose imo but not ugly, 6/10"

9389,"yeah it's weird. but please do post your dht results, i'm interested"
9390,"yeah that's why i just stoped. irl is so so much better bc well for one you know what they look like so you know what to avoid (ex if you hate red heads you can avoid that by simply looking at them whereas online you have no idea), and you know their personality and texting is very misleading compared to irl human emotions. there are many many benifits but these are the basic and main ones. i kinda quit making online friends due to these reasons"
9391,"haha thanks a lot man, i feel more mature and like a man than before. but from this comment it seems like you've been in my past am i correct? more so late 2019 ? your username is really recognizable"
9392,"actually shit your right lmao, i didn't even think to go there bc i go to carleton hence i ""have"" to go there."
9393,doesn't fin have a flat curse dose tho?? so all doses reduces around the same dht?
9394,tbh i had chats with people and it always just dies down. so for me nope. i guess irl is better for me than online friends
9395,i'll keep this in mind thank you doctor!
9396,well r/teenagers but not much now as i used to. and r/make new friends so maybe that's why lol
9397,"this is also a great reply, as the curve dose is flat for finasteride so a extremely low dose is equivalent to 1mg."
9398,"thank you doc, do you think it's normal for a 19 year old to experience low libido/masturbating only once a day ?"
9399,that's what i heard too but some studies contradict each other the only way to prove this is to get ur dht tested before taking fin and retake the test a month after starting fin. that way you'll know how much of a reduction fin suppressed of ur dht
9400,yeah this is true as everyone's different but i think the average 17-20 year old is pretty immature. at least that's what i see with my peers and myself included.
9401,thank you doctor sometimes i think i want to try it but my libido is kinda low and i can only masturbate once a day so i feel like i'm more at risk at getting side effects than the average person
9402,i'm proud of you
9403,you can do stupid immature things and can be forgiven but when ur over 21 mainly ull be seen as a immature adult child and it's just weird and degrading
9404,thanks u!
9405,yeah it's a bit hard for me to speak up but thank you doctor :)
9406,it can sometimes regrow ur hair tho and thicken it
9407,some of those pills look really huge to me then u see a fin pill and it looks like a smarties size lol
9408,well yeah that's normal lol
9409,"ah yeah, have you had sides with sp though?"
9410,not surprised lmao
9411,sounds like a shit ton of supplements though u gotta take.
9412,experience and side effects?
9413,i've never heard of that. the only things proven to stop hairloss/prevent is finasteride and minoxidil.
9414,"you need an oral surgeon to discuss with you, not people here."
9415,"holy shit a nw1 to 3 in 12 months??? i got no idea how i'd act if this happened to me. i also have no family history of early balding, so im the unlucky guy. as for min, i mean sometimes i do think of getting back on it. i still have the bottles. i actually did use it once a day but that was before i showered everyday. i shower basically everyday, so i think this will be something i might reconsider. (i quit and started min 3 times already lmao. this will be my 4th time ill be on it if i decide to start again)"
9416,"balding since 18. i'm still at a nw1.5 1 year later. i'm 19 years old. it worsend my body dysmorphia but i learned to be a man and accept it (through unfortunate events like ending up in the hospital), i just didn't know how to handle it at a young age. anyways though, im doing much better than before."
9417,big sad moment
9418,"np and nah, i accepted it painfully because i just don't want to deal with the potential side effects. i even stopped min bc it just makes my hair way too greasy ( i used the foam). so i just stopped. i'm happy i guess? but it does suck that it's thinning."
9419,seems typical for the ball ache. goodluck man!
9420,"leigit, today i had one girl who was 14, wanted my social media and asked to be friends. another girl (15) on instagram dmed me asking to be added to snapchat i just simply replied with ""sorry you're just too young for me but goodluck"" and left. this week i got a lot of them, it's weird since i normally don't get them."
9421,which won't come out in the next 5 years or so lmao
9422,"i guess you're right for that. i may have forgotten, do you personally take fin?"
9423,maybe it is ineffictive then
9424,"but because the drug was on trial, shouldn't he have followed up with his patients since they got sides to make sure it went away safely? i mean isn't that how ur supposes to run trials like this? idk man. it's been a long time for me too so maybe im missing something."
9425,thanks :) i just have a lot of trouble looking at mirrors. it's to the point i cant wash my hands in bathrooms because i have to look at myself and i dont want strangers looking at me. so i leave without washing my hands and everyone thinks im disgusting..it's just so hard for me
9426,i pissed once with a boner so...
9427,"what about those who got sides, quit, but persistedd (3 months if i recall)? pretty sure that was mentioned in the article too."
9428,"lmao seems like you be getting clout from all the horny dudes :d

id feel praised but at the same time, creeped out as fuck"
9429,imagine having a boner and needing to pee lmao
9430,"this is all you need: respect, care, and being open-minded. also humurous. this is what every guy/girl wants"
9431,you tried finasteride / minoxidil?
9432,i guess i learned to accept it. my hairloss actually destoryed me and later brought me to the hospital. balding at 18 fucking sucks.
9433,"what if you look much worse bald and shit? finasteride increases testesterone and reduces dht by 70%, as well as it decreases important brain steroids that control behaviour/anxiety/etc. it sometimes cause sexual side effects and can also persist even after quitting the drug."
9434,"damn haha, that's crazy though, but i guess they'd make you chuckle a bit right? xd it's better tho then random annoying 14-15 year olds in your dms."
9435,"""are you fat or uh preganat"""
9436,"im assuming ur female.

these guys don't give up do they? lmaoo,gotta give them props for being creative tho haha."
9437,"most likely stress. i remember when i was 18 , tying min for the first time and id always check my heartbeat, and it was obsessive. it was always racing and i never wondered why. prob the same for his case.."
9438,"hi dr. wrassman, i'm curious, if someone has a low sperm count and low libido, is it safe to take finasteride with family backround of low fertility? thanks! i'm too embarrassed to ask my doctor."
9439,there is evidence of pfs. merck lied about the safety profile of finasteride.
9440,"the only way for finasteride to work is for it to go through your bloodstream. topical fin will go to your bloodstream, there are ncbi studies where people who got topical fin vs oral fin had the same reduction of dht. or maybe slightly lower dht but it acts the same way nevertheless."
9441,"finasteride: make sure you get blood tests prior. get estrogen tests done, test, free-test, and dht. just see how your body is behaving behind the scenes. if all is good, then pop your first pill. however i do warn you though that post-finasteride syndrome is very real but only affects a small percentage of people. avoid propecia-help at all costs. once you're in that ringworm, there's no going back, you'll be stuck with bunch of mentally ill people. stay here or hairlosstalk and you should be good to go.

minoxidil: doesn't work all the time, but it can help regrow some hair and thicken since it expands the blood vessels allowing oxygen and nutrients to reach the hair follicles thus altering hair growth. 

dermarolling: basically you needle your scalp. it can be painful af though, so goodluck if you do it. if you're curious just look up dermarolling or microneedling on youtube."
9442,"but like i don't want a 14 year old or 15 year old to be friend when im 19 lmao. trust me, ive talked to a lot of 14-15 year olds when i was a fresh 19 year old. and i realized how annoying/immature they are so i completely stopped. (yeah it seems weird for me to friend 15 year olds when i just turned 19 but tbh, my maturing process was really delayed. i feel much mature now)."
9443,damnnnn u moving outttt. goodluck!!!
9444,"same but for a 20 year old it's weird bc ur at that age where you have to date someone younger than you without making it seem weird. (it's a cultural here at least to be older than the girl). now the gap is up to you, (as long as the gap is legal of course)"
9445,in my hs there are tons of 18 year olds who have dated 15 year olds and ended up all fine.
9446,"i have a couple of 16 year old friends, although yeah it does seem weird for me, i obviously just have casual talks here and there. most of my friends are 18 and above though."
9447,goodluck and don't procasinate..oh wait im doing that rn
9448,zinc is really good for libido
9449,"i have a shit ton that i mostly never take bc im lazy, but here they are:

saw palmetto (2000mg i think)

vitamin d (2000iu)

biotin (10,000mcg)

zinc (20mg)

multivitamins

fish oil

omega 3 supps

brain functioning pills because just for the sake of it."
9450,"i used to be really addicted to r/teenagers but i don't go there much anymore, more so because of the shit posts and i just don't like it there as much as i use to. 

r/askmen and r/young adults is my thing

r/teenagers is still in my interests because some of the memes gives me the shits and giggles but yeah there's a lot of the posts that ur talking about made every 5 minutes. i still relate a lot though to some of the posts and ngl i still have some maturing to do. anyways sorry i wrote too much but i hope your day gets better:)"
9451,"nah it's all good, it's okay i get why you were kinda pissed. all good though :)"
9452,you proved my point. bye kid
9453,"entertain me. what is it? let's say i actually meet a girl and she recorded it. it'll be basic things i ask my friends already everyday ; so nothing weird or creepy. but enlighten me, what is it ? i'm just curious since you seem to be the master of this"
9454,"yeah even though my intentions are nothing like what your thinking of but okay.

have a good day"
9455,nah but you are. ppl ur age (assuming ur 14-15) are just  annoying asf. i should post this on a better sub like make new friends or young adults then here. woopsyyy daisyyyyy
9456,the logic of a guy wanting to make friends with girls two years younger? your probably some 14 year old then if your mind is that closed minded.
9457,i think you are. i get how it seems very weird and shit but you just can't jump to conclusions.
9458,"as friends sure? what's wrong with that? i have male friends but just wanna increases female friends since i got some social anxiety. if you still think it's all perverted then idk what to say man, sorry i guess."
9459,"how is that even remotely perverted, i'll apologize and delete this post and won't do it again if you explain how because this is just an innocent post to make new friends or just call people"
9460,i made it bc i'm just bored af rn that's it that's all
9461,what? so it's wrong to be friends with ppl only two years younger than me? wtf lmao
9462,woop didn't mean it to sound like that. preferably 17+
9463,my bad then lol
9464,"they didn't trust me 

also as a rule of thumb never watch the trailer for any horror movie. for this it gave away a lot (only for the beginning tho) and when i saw certain scenes i already knew what was going to happen because it was in the trailer."
9465,u do know what the plus means right?
9466,i had to watch it a second time to realize that
9467,"""rue the day"" 

reminds me of icarly"
9468,i wonder why lmao
9469,same but 19
9470,he loves his veggies duh
9471,"i'm 19, ur old enough to know even 16 year olds know this 😂😂"
9472,"""i'm sorry - followed by why they are sorry and how they will change (if applicable)"""
9473,i'm 19 this was helpful thx:))
9474,they don't cry when they are around because they try to act strong. like females. our alone time is time to do whatever we want and express emotions without getting judged. it's common sense how old are you to ask this question ??
9475,kinda bs
9476,"get in, blast music, get wet (hot water), use body wash, then shampoo twice then condition, obviously in between i talk to myself or sing along, spend maybe two minutes in hot water and turn off and dry myself"
9477,imagine buying clothes from walmart 😂😂
9478,if you hurt her...
9479,true i used to jam to that at 16 and later realized how it's all chipmunks singing so i stopped and here i am again lmao
9480,"""this little girl"" and ""or nah"" but that's it."
9481,i forgot to vote sorry but i'm in canada
9482,my moms gay
9483,"if i was 11 again i'd help you. i modded my wii at 11 and basically got all games for free from the hebrew channel. just youtube it, that's where i learned it all"
9484,propecia help is just something everyone really needs to stay away from. once your in that ringworm it's hard to get out and your surrounded by mentally ill people.
9485,he looks mad though lmao. probably wants to be an undergrad student.
9486,"same i hate it, im starting to quit subway unless i desp need it/starving."
9487,"""dirty chat time"" lol"
9488,gooddluck lol
9489,"hey im 19m, your hobbies are pretty much what im into lmao. hope we can be friends if ya want, although i'm kinda immature i'm also really humurious and funny at times haha. i love to spread positivity and just enjoy life. anywho though i'll add ur snap"
9490,"19m we can be friends if ya want, tho im kinda immatue but also funny so who knows"
9491,it's cold af here
9492,man this is confusing bc on my last post i had similar examples however they were in rref
9493,really wtf that sucks. my doctor refused as well because i was too young. later on i convinced her but like this subreddit gave me severe anxiety sadly (well mostly propecia help)  that i'm still healing so fin is just not for me.
9494,sounds like those guys who uses bro science to deceive someone.
9495,same and i'm studying math rn
9496,fuck
9497,ohhh okay i understand thanks
9498,"thank you, i actually did it by rows not columns but i'll be more careful next time"
9499,ohhh i see i wrote a 3 by accident. ah this is why it's so easy to make a mistake and seem so lost
9500,wait your saying the middle row 3 should be a one ? but i did the calculation and i got 3
9501,haha thanks! i definately will
9502,i realized that when i was waiting 30 minutes for the 10 😭but oh well i'm here now

9504,"thank god it's open and thank you for sharing this link, gladly appreciate it"
9505,thanks man i needed that!!
9506,"really sad that university students would steal from others, high school is one thing but in uni really? focus on yourself ugh"
9507,"man im a noob for where that is, but i'll find it! hopefully people are around as i never been to carleton on weekends haha"
9508,alright thanks !

9529,ur arab im arab we are destined
9530,"why is everyone thinking i said something weird, all i said hes good looking but just looks way too young. i'm guessing the ""holy damn"" is misleading, i said that because i didnt know he looked that young."
9531,why do you look like eleven from stranger things
9532,"nothing attractive really sparks me, kinda just average/normal. 5/10"
9533,"holy damn. you're a good looking guy, but damn you look 12. crazy"

9540,only if you put it in ur anal
9541,i haven't used the lrt in a long time i always use the s1 buses now
9542,"i legimatiely despise 8:30am classes. i really thought i was able to do it but waking up at 6am every tuesdays just messed up my sleep schedule and im always tired to attend to my bio labs (even if i sleep really early). this was my wake up call to never take 8:30am classes, if you live in orleans"
9543,stupid 18-20 year olds thinking they are edgy teens lmao
9544,"yeah exactly it really sucks, i don't even remember seeing pedos commenting on tv shows i don't think they hardly ever do so idk why they would disable a cartoon show. maybe monitor it? but don't disable it."
9545,it's so easy for them to lie about their age though
9546,"i get it, it just sucks because i loved reading all the comments bc you don't feel alone"
9547,thanks bro!
9548,i wasn't trynna hit on her though sometimes i get real anxiety texting people i know irl it's something i'm trying overcome lmaooo

9573,ok emily
9574,okay
9575,just curious how did he feel when he was loosing it and at what age did he start losing it  ??
9576,okay but it's obvious she is if you look at her replies and the fact she deleted her post (unless you did)
9577,if i recall correctly 38%
9578,pretty sure it blocks 38% of dht if i remember correctly
9579,i uh..

9586,back to r/askwomen
9587,"holy shit, you look actually fucking hot. a hot anime dude if i can say without getting attacked. this is my first time doing this, but i rate you a 8.5/10."
9588,your hair is such fucking goals man.
9589,"it's all about the camera and lens. some lens will be flattering, others will be complete shit. mirrors are 3d and cameras are 2d. remember when you take a picture, your converting a 2d image into 3d which can cause some deformities."
9590,i think ur gucci
9591,"ur underage you cant post here.

you look like those 10 year old girls from horror movies, you can determine yourself if that's good or bad. but i'm not gonna rate you, wait till ur 16."
9592,you look like someone i'd hang with and do stupid shit and laugh it off. can you confirm if this is true???
9593,"attention whore/10 or you have body dysmorphia. but more likely the first one. body dysmorphia usually occurs to those who are *actually* ugly.

edit: looking at your replies, attention whore/10."
9594,this deadass cracked me up lmfao
9595,i don't really find anything attractive tbh. sorry. 19m
9596,"are you arab by any chance?? anyways i don't think your ugly bro, just maybe sleep."
9597,"my answer is very biased (19m), but im not into that short haired stuff. but others will definately as it's kinda a trend here. anyways though i'll just give you a 6/10 bc i don't see anything ugly about you."
9598,normal/10 for me
9599,"7/10 imo. 

really great body and shit, you good homie"
9600,"literally average 5/10. 

you give me the geek/nerd vibe (not sayin that's bad)"
9601,"honestly i don't even know. i'm saying a 6/10 but something's pulling me back to say 4/10. 

it just gives me a weird vibe, but i'm sure others will be attracted to it. just not my type"
9602,haha all good my man
9603,"literally the point of this sub is to answer the infamous question ""am i ugly"". that's it. it doesn't say ""am i ugly - but please be nice and no rude comments uwu"". 

his comment was nowhere rude, he explained why she was ugly and gave her a rating. not sure why he's downvoted.

edit: ok he didn't give a reason, my bad, i was looking at the wrong comment. but still, it's his opinion, i wouldn't say 1/10 but she's def below average imo."
9604,this is why you have ur birthdays in the summer
9605,"lol writing ""your beautiful just the way you are"" in a jaw subreddit isn't really the lingo here"
9606,i'm 19 and getting this surgery so do i need proper tounge posture then? since you said as an adult you shouldn't worry? or should i worry?
9607,upvote bc idk what to say in this situation but goodluck and don't think about it much
9608,at least it'll be in the summer tho and more time to join clubs and stuff as a first yearrr
9609,your the reason why this sub's honesty is going downhill.
9610,i wish it was 2 weeks but then again we finish in 2 months wohooo although i do have summer school.
9611,that's goood !
9612,damn i guess i can't complain then goodluckkk
9613,same!!! those labs i have to wake up at 6am for i'm gonna cry
9614,"i'm one of them, mainly because i want to use the time to get all of my shows/movies watched. hangout, work, use social media. i mean i don't have midterms this week so my answer is probably not what your looking for"
9615,"just for, you know, the next 8 hours then i'll finally start studying"
9616,finally omggg i despise winter
9617,"i play cod mw and it's toxic af which i love because i'm toxic too. black ops 1 was toxic same with bo2 and mw2,3. i'm so happy we have the old game chat back"
9618,same
9619,yaya i have time then to do stupid things
9620,"i think it's normal but science says your still a teenager at 20 because your brain is not even done developing (your maturity and decision making skills)

at 19 and 20 is really the same thing as nothing happens overnight but it feels so weird holy shit. it'll be weird to do immature things at 20 since at 19 your still a teen so u can do it. but your still gonna do stupid things at 20, a prime example is justin bieber when he was 20.

don't worry about it."
9621,used him since grade 11 he's a genius
9622,thanks for reminding me about math since i haven't opened my books in two weeks.
9623,"lol ya ikr i just find it crazy ya know all the porn stuff i always think that's how it is, but prob bc im a virgin"

9629,i really don't because it's against my religion
9630,maybe she misses you tbh
9631,goodluck
9632,reading these comments made me feel better as i thought porn was really what sex was like. it's very violent and angry so i just watch lesbo to avoid that.

9635,lmao
9636,deadass facts

9638,i'll be on the lookout for that but when if i ask that ill just feel awkward bc they'll think im a weird kind of person
9639,i'll be on the lookout for that but when if i ask that ill just feel awkward bc they'll think im a weird kind of person
9640,"thank you the only problem i see with that is often people say things like ""ohh you look good "" or ""your handsome""! and it actually makes me feel even worse and i get so weirded out bc im heavily believed im gross. so i avoid anything that could potentially bring those comments up. sadly this is a potential situation :p"

9642,"true i can do that, also sadly my hairs thinning to at only 19 (started last year which destoryed me in hs) anyways that's a crazy long story, but i get extremely embarrassed when stuff like that gets mentioned by a barber."
9643,"true i can do that, also sadly my hairs thinning to at only 19 (started last year which destoryed me in hs) anyways that's a crazy long story, but i get extremely embarrassed when stuff like that gets mentioned by a barber."
9644,"ohh probably, it happened to me too. during my dark times, my friend was also suicidal and after 4 days she said she didn't get the text and replied with a long paragraph trying to support me. we talk all the time now, but tbh i never found out if she read the reciepts from the notification system and forgot to respond or she was trying to think of something and took her 4 days to respond. either way it worked out in the end.

goodluck man"
9645,"yeah sorry man dont double text unless you know her very well but obviously not. she got the text, the chances she didn't is 1% (although has happened to me before but it's very very rare). was it snapchat? if it says opened your doomed. same with ""seen"" on instagram or ""read"" from imessage"
9646,lmao same
9647,tank u
9648,thank you a lot man :) appreciate this
9649,ah yeah!
9650,"that sounds kinda gross,,,okay maybe i should to actually wear sunscreen then. thanks for the headsup, i didnt know that would happen (although i obviously know skin cancer is a thing)."
9651,"im 19 so this helped yeah, im trying to change my relatonship with my parents because i always give attitude, but im naturally like that and even if i wanna show emotion im always like awkward so i dont try to pursure at all.

last part sounds pretty good. thank you"
9652,"i save, but im spending 15k out of pocket for orthadontic treatment and other thousands for uni...so i have no choice but to save lmao"
9653,"i save, but im spending 15k out of pocket for orthadontic treatment and other thousands for uni...so i have no choice but to save lmao"
9654,18 and 28 sounds brutal lol
9655,18 and 28 sounds brutal lol
9656,does it matter if you're a really picky eater?
9657,"i havent worn sunscreen for a year, but my skin looks the same. it's winter currently, do i still have to wear sunscreen?? i also thankfully don't smoke/vape"
9658,"ball torchure & starvation

your balls will be very sore then explode after slow and hard whips.then you'll be starving at the same time. captivity really."
9659,i don't date so i dunno :/
9660,"ah i see, thank you:)"
9661,damn
9662,what happens if you don't learn from them ?
9663,0
9664,-0.2
9665,my mom told me xd
9666,"im not worried anymore but i made a snaphat post where i was giving away spotfy gift card and i said ""if you dont want to participate dm me no"" and she dms me no out of all people. i lowkey wanted her to win to show her i can be nice but oh well. why would she say no though? i have no clue. she did ask me at work what the giveaway was for, i said spotify but i forgot what she replied with. i also dont think she uses spotify bc she doesnt listen to music much so theres that too.  but who wouldnt want a free card?"
9667,yeah im known to overthink a lot. i'll stop. and asking her well that's awkward for me tbh
9668,"that sucks man:(

can u help me with my recent post pls"
9669,r/teenagers motivated me to text my crush back in the day and bc of them i made a good bond sooo
9670,sleeeeep
9671,me rn actually
9672,hott
9673,it helps me get out of bed lol
9674, ah okay so it's just life experience and self improvement that help improve maturity
9675,ikr :(
9676,yes !! it's an illusion
9677,oof true maybe your actually born a year younger maybe it's all a lie???
9678,yeah honestly i was thinking that too. once go from 19 to 20 i highly doubt you'll mature up like you expect from 17 to 18. your still gonna think like a 19 year old. i say 21 is probably the prime age where you grow out of things maybe. i'll see when i'm 21 lmao
9679,"well it kinda depends, the maturity of a 18-19 year old isn't that much different than that of a 17 year old. plus i'm 19 and in first year uni and a lot of the memes i see i can still relate to in first year.

orrr i'm just still immature."
9680,my flair went from 19 to 18 i was like hell yeah but realized i can't do that :(
9681,lmao
9682,me
9683,so true
9684,"i think i'll officially leave the sub when i'm 21. i'm only there for the memes because i can always relate to them and sometimes make posts when i'm really bored or ask for relationship/social advice (allot of them are really good at helping for that stuff) but your right it's kinda going downhill for the amount of attention whoring posts like ""fuck you, dad"" and whatnot. it was literally the best sub i've joined but later on for me itll be time to leave. i also made some friends there."
9685,i feel you i have a manager that i truly adore but he's a store manager for many years so i doubt he's leaving anytime soon. i love him to death and he has helped me with my mental problems in the past. best manager ever.
9686,weeks is absurd imo
9687,i do know my history wasn't the greatest and i made wrong decisions but i'm slowly getting better and stuff. i don't really exaggerate but it is true that i did seem suspicious and me lashing out is entirely my fault which  i said sorry for. i realized my mistake later on.
9688,sure y not
9689,i got yelled at but it's all good i apologized and she seemed to grt over it quickly
9690,yeah lol tru
9691,thank you my good sir for the advice i appreciate it
9692,"sometimes i feel this, the asexual part"
9693,thank you :) i will
9694,yeah i definately will i mean i still need guidance in my life but i also need to be clear with her for stuff like that. it gets annoying sometimes but it's worthwhile for having an older sibling. and yes she's 25
9695,she's kinda controlling with how i spend my money like just let me spend how i want it and if i fuck up then ill learn from my mistakes. just growing up things. but it's more because i have to pay 15k for my orthadontist treatment so maybe that's why she's very strict with me.
9696,i'm giving them away for my awesome friends who helped me during my darkest times the past months i only spent 40 bucks which isn't much to me
9697,guess u know by now
9698,"omg this is gold 

i wanna call it the bieber-fever syndrome"
9699,"aw thanks if you ever think your alone your not! have an amazing day and winter break 

and yeah kids help phone like is a truly amazing experience. i was scared to use it at first as it was my first time but the man over the phone was so kind and amazing. he's such a great guy. i highly reccomend it even tho people assume it's only for high schoolers hence the name ""kids"""
9700,finasteridr can cause pfs
9701,i just missed it bc my other bus came late so i had to wait 30m now it's coming in 10m hopefully it's cold as fuck tho
9702,i used kids help phone and it's amazing and university students can use it too (age range is from 5-20)
9703,watching youtube
9704,positive affirmation videos
9705,holy shit
9706,no
9707,it's fake
9708,i work at mcdonald's and i'm 19 my location is fabulous
9709,same stuck at 85
9710,true
9711,thank you i'll do that tmwr
9712,"makes sense, damn it"
9714,well justin bieber made a insta post about his mental health and he wrote a long long paragraph and managed to fit everything into one paragraph without having to screen shot everything so i was just curious how you'd do that even turning my phone side ways it doesn't help much
9715,"anyone know how to fit a huge block of text from the ""notes"" app into one page without having to screenshot everything ?"
9716,true but it's only three years as in i'm  a freshman and we both had school and we both worked in the same job plus im kinda immature so it all worked out nice. imo 17 and 20 isn't bad since she's over the consent age and it's just three years
9717,thanks doctor!
9718,thanks bro appreciate it
9719,are the midterm questions based off the slides because the quiz and mock midterm were questions from the slides but i don't wanna get misguided
9720,eh screw that i'd rather just casually shave it like normal
9721,i don't drink coffee
9722,ohh haha thanks! kinda was insecure about it but now i know its normal :)
9723,i do but i hate the stubble it leaves though i've seen guys with smooth necks with no hair and then there's me
9724, no
9725,i think we all know this lol
9726,no homo ur a 7/10
9727,the white and three blacks at it again
9728,everytime man reason i dont is cuz i sometimes really personal shit lol
9729,i mean u were 19 like a few days/months ago so i don't think magically you turn so mature lol
9730,19 gang gang
9731,ur a doctor but active in r/teenagers what??
9732,snap name?
9733,"though i don't mind that because i have nothing to hide i quit fb because i just hate how it is now.

snapchat is probably the only platform that fb doesn't own or isn't part of."
9734,i laughed way too hard at this
9735,"yeah i get it, works sucks"
9736,"i guess you read my post history for you to know the cops came before.
and your right lol sorry"
9737,lets goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
9738,crazy!
9739,ohhh well still
9740,"i think at our age it's normal, you can find a 15 year old attractive and that's totally okay imo but actually dating her and what not well that crosses the lines. fantasizing and stuff is one thing but acting is another 

it also depends on the age of consent. i'm 19 and consent is 16 so my range is 16-19. i have coworkers who are 15 and some literally look like kids others look someone who had butt implants or whatever it's crazy. anyways though, my maturity although more matured not significantly different than that of a 16-17 year old so i guess it's easy for me to get along with them."
9741,"16-19 

depends really, here in my culture at least we gotta go for the younger one bc that's just how it works and all of my hs has dates younger than them. so i just followed that trend. my maturity is not significant to go for anyone over 20"
9742,don't we all lol
9743,"it's alright man! start by showering daily because it'll honestly keep you relaxed and awake. next thing is to shave and try to take care of yourself! baby steps man, naturally you'll meet along the way. do it now, it's so easy in high school, but incredibly hard in university"
9744,i'm here for you man..i feel you
9745,"nvm they figured it out, thanks!"
9746,"nvm they figured it out, thanks!"
9747,"they dont know how, how do you do that?"
9748,alright thanks!
9749,"no because i was there for the whole 24 hour period since i saw the lock symbol for the priv story when you swipe all the way right in the feed thing 

so either she didn't post anything today or i got removed but it doesn't make sense if she does it now and not 24 hours ago lmao"
9750,thanks!
9751,ohhh so doing so gets you (-i^2) z which results in just z?
9752,but i dont understand why you multiply both sides by -i. is there a reason for  this?
9753,question is to simply into z=a+bi
9754,true
9755,yes sir 👌👌
9756,my pain ended an hour ago but i can't complain i worked 6 hours
9757,it's ok you had to do this

9761,islam is ur optoonv

9764,everyone thinks im 16 lmao
9765,me
9766,including urs
9767,nightcore wtf lmao
9768,"how i listened it, i don't see a correlation"
9769,"that's good that a girl confirmed it's cute if a guy sang this to her. i soind like a donkey tho but hey yolo right ? 

yeah i really love it, tbh i'm a huge fan not only for his music but mostly for his advice, suppprt, and the evolution of jb. he has changed so much and he gives
me lots of motivation. 

oof that was kinda deep anyways ya"
9770,that'll be my soulmate!!! thanks sir u too
9771,i think im only guy here that would acc listen to jb for real
9772,still tho that's impressive here most ppl graduate at 22-24
9773,i think it's the second one that's more likely
9774,play cod mw cyber attack. it's filled with mic's and toxic players
9775,"he's gonna do it, i was warned but did it but learned from it. i'm 19 now and improved a bit"

9779,"don't kill me but i really like love me from him it's a old ass song but the lyrics kinda is deep if you look into it. i wanna sing it to a girl one day and hopefully she likes cheesy shit 

another of my favourite is sorry but i haven't listened to his new songs that's releasing so my taste might change"
9780,i apologize
9781,lmao
9782,"honest i can even imagine it rn, like imagining my crush and i together and starting a family. huge responsibility but i'm still in school so i'll lay that aside"
9783,"damn i'm not even ready for that haha i'm only 19 tho, but it's good you do these things on weekends, it gives you some reward of being a good father"
9784,ah okay makes sense i guess
9785,damn... do you ever get bored of that same old routine every dang day ??
9786,basically
9787,"pretty sure most 17-19 year olds would be like ""wtf act your age"""
9788,i like where this is going
9789,well i'm not that desperate i just like his support and life advice since he dealt with so much shit sooo he's a role model for me
9790,yes i do me thank u i'm the biggest fan out there 🤡
9791,sad bruh moment for me
9792,this never gets old
9793,little did she know youtube would be the biggest video sharing website  in the world
9794,damn
9795,what is it if i may ask?
9796,you forgot fapping from mw
9797,yea same tbh
9798,thats a good song
9799,no homo??
9800,"just out of curiosity, why move out of ur parents? it's extremely common to live with your parents at 18-21 years old. here at least, rent is crazy expensive. you'll save even more money by living with your parents for a couple of years."
9801,finasteride?
9802,or finasteride
9803,"all i remember being 12-13 was modding my wii to get free games without having to buy them...

and now a days, 13 year olds are either twerking or raging at fortnite. 
it's a nightmare"
9804,canadian here. 19m here. this is exactly what i did at 18-19 before starting first-year university.
9805,theres restictons actually. the person just cant be 5 years older than the person
9806,lmao
9807,if u have it with mark there's no test today
9808,yeah same
9809,thanks bro
9810,"ohhhh i see😂😂

i legit look 16 so i guess i fit in plus my maturity ah

also nah man ur not even old yet"
9811,"well right now we did vectors (adding subtracting graphing, vector projections, unit vectors) and we just started doing matrices"
9812,"well depends how old you are if your like over 22 i find that weird

oh nvm i'm dumb i didn't read ur flair yeah i guess ur fine but don't go for like <16 year olds lol"
9813,oof i'm not there yet calm
9814,how is it for u so far
9815,updoot
9816,aww sad
9817,i'm in linear algebra haha
9818,lucky lil shit
9819,yeah true i feel you man. i mean i don't have much responsibility at all but i do pay for lots of shit but ur still young bro
9820,"you are young, young man!!!! im 19 but tbh even at 20 ill feel like a teenager since there's not much of a difference between yesterday when ur 19 and the day after (ur b-day)"
9821,so why can't the express buses just go straight to downtown then if this is gonna be a hastle for us anyways...
9822,"this is more about me, but how the fuck do  i stop being so immature and start to relate to people around my age? i do understand hanging out with then more and more is helpful but thing is, i'm scared as hell to hang, or they just dont have time for me. not sure where to turn, i usually stay at home, watch youtube, study, and browse reddit. i missed a lot of the fun i should've had in my early-mid teens. maybe im just trying to relive those moments? idk, being 19 is weird sometimes for me."
9823,i like dick i mean pusy
9824,"that's so true, i guess i was so used to hanging out with younger ppl (again i was alone, at home, only working at mcd so i was constantly around them, plus i was kinda immature for my age at 18, so that played a big role lol). anywyas, i'm trying to mature up and hang with people around my age and relate to them more than people who are 16 lol"
9825,"i guess because your brain chemistry is so used to the drugs/alcohol in your system that when you discontinue, your neurosteroids/hormones go crazy resulting in the symtons since your brain is going like ""where's the drugs i need them!!!"""
9826,here legal age is 18 but age of consent is 16. i mean im 19 so for me 16 is my limit
9827,oh ya
9828,lol imagine being ina uni party an the girl is acc a prodigy and is 16 years old.
9829,"im 19 who looks 16

... jailbaittt"
9830,yo it's hot dont change a thing
9831, a lot. but im 19. my dad kept growing at 19-20 years old
9832,ah okay that's good. yeah obviously i dont creep on them since i find it weird myself.
9833,big oof
9834,just talk
9835,you look 12 so can't rate
9836,aww haha it's cute
9837,"well mainly because if your a introvert or someone that lacks social skills it'll be hard to start conversation with people. i kinda fear rejection so it's hard for me to ask for their snaps or whatever if i want to stay in contact with them. it's a huge huge transition from hs and you'll be in a completely new environment surrounded by thousands of people you don't know. i guess confidence is key in this so like they say, fake it till you make it. it'll be worthwhile if you make friends here :))"
9838,i hate that
9839,so basically you eat ur poop again
9840,got emmm
9841,wholesome as fuck

9852,just wear headphones and ur set
9853,"the commute from orleans to carleton is 1h 30m long sadly (via oc transpo) but i'm also in first year. to get friends literally join clubs. it's super hard since your in first year. you'll save so much money which is the reason why i chose to stay home. 

goodluckkk:))"
9854,yeah u can dm me what's wrong but me pretty goooddd
9855,haha true
9856,eh even that its all g imo
9857,if ur just 20 it's ok since ur basically still a teen in the inside like u were 19 yesterday or whatever..not much changed
9858,same but i don't get the reason for it
9859,why?? fin has a curve flaat dose so 1mg and 0.00004mg wouldn't make a difference
9860,i like songs
9861,lol snake
9862,"okay i can't argue with that, i kinda feel you, my dads around the same age as you and has friends but sometimes seems lonely. hope you find someone"

9874,"19m palestine so arab but i'm not ""cute"" tho i'm getting surgery lmao"
9875,"heyy, how've you been lately ??"
9876,would a surgeon do the surgery again if this happens ?
9877,yeah i'd agree tbh
9878,ah yes this one ! thank you :)
9879,she's literally the definition of a basic white girl holy shit and rarely ever replies to comments. attention seeker
9880,r u 20 or older ?
9881,they'll prob just make tik toks but boys they'll prob try to irritate you
9882,you look like a doll
9883,thank you i'll bring it up with my surgeon in my next appointment!
9884,but why would it widen after surgery? i never seen anyone complain about their nose widening so i guess it's not noticeable enough ?
9885,lucky you! they normally live in groups. have fun sleeping tonight.
9886,the shit i’d do to hear any of his songs again for the first time.
9887,yeah it’s a little more than a little much.
9888,how is he a simp for that?
9889,back in your bed and to fucking sleep
9890,what happened?
9891,are you like 10?
9892,"i just downvoted your comment

faq

what does this mean?

the amount of karma (points) on your comment and reddit account has decreased by one.

why did you do this?

there are several reasons i may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. these include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠rudeness towards other redditors, •	⁠spreading incorrect information, •	⁠sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

am i banned from the reddit?

no - not yet. but you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. otherwise i will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

i don't believe my post deserved a downvote. can you un-downvote it?

sure, mistakes happen. but only in exceedingly rare circumstances will i undo a downvote. if you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what i got wrong. i tend to respond to reddit pms within several minutes. do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

how can i prevent this from happening in the future?

accept the downvote and move on. but learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on reddit.com. i will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. remember: reddit is privilege, not a right."
9893,why would you wait an hour before you go back and screenshot your comment?
9894,no because i haven’t gotten anything.
9895,oh no not a fucking glove
9896,what the fuck are you talking about?
9897,i don’t
9898,but you were listening to it¿
9899,just because you don’t like em is no reason he shouldn’t win. he’s done a lot. he isn’t my favorite but he has done his share of stuff
9900,what’s it called? the newest one i’m seeing is in 2018
9901,he has really good potential. if he does keep it up he will make it big. god damn i just love almost all his music just his voice and flow and everything.
9902,"to be honest i don’t really like a whole lot of chief keef but i do like a couple songs. from kendrick i like stuff like swimming pools, poetic justice, fear, love, and don’t kill my vibe but i haven’t found much more stuff like that. don’t think i’ve ever listened to saba"
9903,i’ve been listening to nav for a good while.
9904,i fucking love polo g. out of everything on spotify i think there is one song i don’t like and it’s from like 2018. he would easily be in my top 5 if he had more music out.
9905,i mean i don’t hate you for those same reasons..
9906,that sunburn isn’t going to be fun. he should probably not wear shorts and a tshirt.
9907,i haven’t fully listened to their old stuff but i know they got a couple of good songs on the older stuff just haven’t listened to much of it.
9908,fucking insane. the whole album is amazing.
9909,i wouldn’t go that far but it is a very good album
9910,they won’t. if culture 3 isn’t like the first they might as well be done.
9911,no because nothing has changed. i’m still outside and riding around like normal just not at school.
9912,are you retarted??
9913,0-10 in numerical order would best the same as chronological if you start at 0.
9914,you definitely ain’t playing music near me
9915,nav gets hate for absolutely no reason.
9916,are you slow?

10378,you look cute without the glasses. idk what it is about the glasses but i’m not feeling them it makes you look off.
10379,we don’t know. you could be fine or you couldn’t. that’s why you don’t get black market cartridges.

10382,my room is better than a lot of people
10383,you know what snapping is?
10384,d
10385,the more and more you post this the more i realize how shit you look. you might think you look alright which isn’t a bad thing to think but you’re probably posting this hoping someone will like you because you can’t keep a real relationship because you think you’re better than everyone so no one likes you irl.
10386,i prefer checkers but i can’t i’m about to go to sleep it’s  3:30
10387,i’m right here baby
10388,i know your ugly ass can’t relate so why do you keep doing it?
10389,i usually have a pile of clothes i like to wear if i only wore for a day any didn’t do anything so they aren’t dirty. it usually contains pair of jeans or two and a shirt or two.
10390,it looks like a fucking cheeto
10391,yes
10392,wrong sub or am i missing something?
10393,or you could share wit me

10409,you definitely look much better without your underwear showing.
10410,i hope the brain cells i lost went to him because he is in need of them more than i am.
10411,why are you asking this on r/instagram ?
10412,you just sound like a bitch if you ask me
10413,you must be fun at parties. i doubt it’s really that big of an issue
10414,yessir but i think it she might  be a mix

10428,just very curious for if the chance for recreational use comes up if i should definitely avoid it.
10429,oh yeah it was definitely in a hospital. i was just wondering if i’d have a allergic reaction to oxycodone also. i don’t believe it was life threatening but i may be wrong.
10430,i was like 3(i may have been a little older i really don’t know ) and had surgery and they gave me lortab and i had a allergic reaction
10431,i’m not too sure because i was a baby but i can ask my mom tomorrow
10432,that’s not good at all. you need to eat

10494,what the fuck is that.
10495,it may not be the best idea to swallow toothpaste but small amounts won’t really harm you maybe just a upset stomach. you’d have to swallow a large amount because it really becomes dangerous.

10505,um what happened? did i miss something?
10506,i think that’s called a orgasm
10507,“i warned him about getting horny” see the issue is it’s not like you can control it.

10517,“so far i like you but i don’t really know you”
10518,find something to keep yourself  busy
10519,well it depends if they want to convict you as an adult or child. it could go either ways depending.
10520,the level entirely depends on which lvl is first. if the lvl 40 is fire then the pe will be 40. if the lvl 2 is first it will be lvl 2 but you’ll get your coins and scrolls back.
10521,yeah idk but i get depressed when i find out someone likes me idk why. but she messaged me and we been talking and it’s been good and i’m happy again

10527,how about big dick bobby
10528,i mean it’s possible. should you try to do that? it’s probably not that great for your mental health.
10529,what do you wear then?
10530,now this is top tier
10531,"hi, wanna have anal sex"
10532,oh i’ll stick my pp in you dw
10533,probably
10534,vibe check
10535,and why would you do that?

10538,are you serious?
10539,dare: fuck me in the ass
10540,bitch what?
10541,i don’t believe so
10542,the “are you serious” is so fire
10543,dreams and nightmares and march madness fire
10544,"plus tax means it’s the price before tax, “this shirt was $10.92 after tax”  would be the total price."

10553,just keep closing and reopening the game and it’ll eventually load right
10554,e
10555,a pound is about 3500 calories so 8k calories is about 2 pounds. but anyways good joke
10556,i don’t think it’s physically possible to have that many
10557,if a males test positive it can be a signal for testicular cancer and you should see your doctor
10558,it isn’t art. they are probably laundering money or they just have an excess of money they don’t need. no where in the world it is considered art.
10559,"ass but still need some tits, cute, and short"
10560,it is terrible but it’s done well
10561,"not just that, you look small."
10562,how i deal with everything else. go to my room and listen to music.
10563,you look like your 7
10564,never heard that one before
10565,drinking ice cold water does help your body more then warm water. you actually do burn more calories drinking ice cold water but it’s nothing significant so don’t count on it as a diet.
10566,you are more stupid than my dead grandma
10567,"i usually have my fan on, my music, and my weighted and electric blanket."
10568,can’t help you with that. i’m just an idea guy.
10569,poison him. put something in his food or on a pencil that is absorbed into the skin
10570,they may not be all that powerful alone but usually they hunt in groups which would make it pretty dangerous
10571,ngl you kinda do
10572,what? there isn’t anything wrong here
10573,why not
10574,somefbiagent is this you?

10578,i’ll try. i’m not sure if it’s true but i hear a dude who is a bout to turn 18 is going out with someone who is 14 and that’s pretty weird to me
10579,"yeah it is kinda weird but i’ll just see when we go back to school tuesday, i mean i rarely even see her during school because she’s in middle and i’m a junior."
10580,"idk, i thinking about if i should do something cause she is really cute but then again i don’t know she is  13(?).  i mean most of our parents i can say have a way bigger gap then 3 years."
10581,la
10582,i know but i looked it up and it’s legal
10583,i think she’s 13? but she doesn’t look it at all
10584,yeah a girl told me i was fine asf but she’s a little younger then me and i can’t stop thinking about her
10585,lmao
10586,oh okay the no matter what it won’t be to much longer

10595,no it won’t
10596,fuck off pussy

10632,how the fuck did you reply so fast
10633,how about taking a shower at 8:45 because you just woke up from your 3 hour nap and now i won’t be back asleep till around 1:30-2 but it’s fine because i do this daily
10634,he doesn’t? it’s his fucking bones are you mentally challenged?
10635,well it’s probably does have sugar in it. if something is below a certain amount of calories or below a certain amount of grams of sugar then can legally say it has 0 sugar or 0 calories. tic tacs are almost all sugar but it’s below the threshold allowing them to say it’s sugar free.
10636,it’d probably be weird as most people would have moved on after months
10637,"moisturizer,cocoa butter,etc, or stop shaving daily"

10673,"did you just misspell a word? did you seriously just misspell a word in your title? i am literally shaking. my entire day is ruined. when i scroll through reddit, i expect quality content. no; i expect perfection. how dare you ruin this morning and take away the only thing that i hold dear, which is a pristine and well-written production? who up-voted this? which one of you miscreants up-voted this post? did you not notice the misspelling? do you just not care? do you think that spelling doesn't matter? would you turn this into your professor or your boss? i honestly cannot believe that you have replaced a letter that belongs with a letter that does not belong and in doing so have brought such an incredible shame and disgrace upon me, my day, this sub, this website, and everyone's lives that a thousand oceans could never cleanse your hands of this inexcusable and deplorable mistake."
10674,well who produced it?
10675,that beat is god damn fire holy fuck
10676,when did he say this year?
10677,i was pretty confused also
10678,"there was a time... probably at least five years ago that they could be equal, but android is just not a logical choice these days."
10679,that’s a fucking power move
10680,hey dumbass
10681,b
10682,ok
10683,i deadass have no idea how this guy basically wooooshed himself and got 1.1k upvotes
10684,this isn’t really a woooosh
10685,fuck off with this already
10686,bitch what?
10687,n
10688,money kept appearing was pretty good also but i prefer it’s a rack
10689,a fuckin’ fendi fact
10690,y

10692,stop
10693,fuck the wife
10694,yeah but your not really doing any damage

10698,damn this isn’t interesting
10699,how is one supposed to read this
10700,wait it’s not random?
10701,steve o?
10702,"hey dumbass, nsfw"
10703,why are you like this?
10704,i’m saying your penis looks weird.
10705,yet he has it saved
10706,i’d be worried if my penis looked like that. should you be worried? no. to me it looks pearly penile papules which is nothing to be concerned about.
10707,not all websites have that
10708,don’t tag them in it. normally when someone says don’t @ me they mean like “lil wayne is the best rapper don’t @me” saying they don’t wanna argue about it so don’t reply or mention them.
10709,oh my fucking god if you could learn to spell
10710,i’m not saying you should. i’m just saying there are health benefits to masturbation and also nofap.
10711,normally over time hair tends to grown especially over a period of 130 days.
10712,me too it’s only 2am
10713,no but i’m sure i can find an article of the benefits of masturbation
10714,ty for all your help with moderating
10715,"it’s not really a place to live, from what i remember seeing it’s just an area to garden"
10716,is english your first language?
10717,yes
10718,do you prefer the saw blade because of the speed?
10719,someone most likely hired them to steal it for them
10720,then you wouldn’t have ads
10721,yta if you report them. you don’t even know when they did or if they even did anything.
10722,we get the week off here in la
10723,it doesn’t work like that

11324,"geez, the cheapest i can find it is $150 used."

11365,sleep is for the weak
11366,"i have a 2ds xl so i don’t really know (the 2ds plays all 3ds games, it just doesn’t have 3d). i don’t think many people use the 3d effect but there are also a lot of people who do use it. is the console you’re looking at buying a “new 3ds?” because the “new 3ds” has eye tracking 3d which makes it so no matter what position you’re in it’s comfortable on your eyes. if it’s an older 3ds model then it’s pretty hard to get into the right position for the 3d to be good."
11367,"yes the console is definitely worth buying, i would buy it out for 100€ because that’s a pretty good deal and someone else is going to buy it. the 3ds has a massive library of amazing games, and the 3ds is also a really good portable console, it can fit in your pocket. i really recommend you get it."
11368,"yes of course, transfer all your data over to the 3ds xl, the 3ds xl has bigger screens which i find to be much better."
11369,yeah that’s normal don’t worry
11370,"not really, there’s copies of the 3ds version everywhere and i got one on ebay for $5 the other day."
11371,i’ve been looking at picking it up! is it definitely worth it?
11372,what call of duty are you talking about?
11373,"pokémon sun/moon!

they are amazing pokémon games and deserve more credit, they tried so many new things with these games and i love them."

11384,"yes, it turned itself off after 10 minutes (it was fully charged)."

11573,"tell me one memorable move besides the stunner stone cold had.


stone cold is still one of the best wrestlers of all time. 

hell, roman still has good moves."
11574,"roman is the better wrestler; he can make a match far more engaging than dolph ever could. he has better in ring presence and mic skills.

also, roman doesn't literally do a superman punch and then a spear and that's it. if you watched his matches, you'd know that's not the case."
11575,from the matches i've seen? walter vs tyler bate at takeover cardiff
11576,are you saying that dolph should be a top star instead of roman?

11583,"this is fucking stupid. i was actually excited for this match, but for fucks sake. this is just stupid.


just have a normal fucking match, none of these retarded gimmick matches. these two can produce an engaging match together, just having a gimmick match is too finicky, annoying and takes me out of the illusion.


of course wwe ruins an actually anticipated and intriguing match with one of their stupid fucking retarded gimmick matches that don't service the match in the slightest."

11597,"thanks bby, luv u 🥰"
11598,"yeah, thanks bby"
11599,"lmfao, you ok?"
11600,wwe are taking the necessary precautions needed. i think they should cancel all wrestling after wrestlemania.
11601,"they're already going to have a match. mania is already going through. have it done and over with now so we don't spread these matches far and wide, increasing risk."
11602,"no, because usually, he has dumbass takes on certain things, he also showcases a bias towards aew in most of these."
11603,because the storylines would lose all heat by then. cancel all wrestling after wrestlemania is what i think.
11604,i would guess maybe... 20% know.
11605,"braun strowman vs goldberg, when i think about it more, doesn't seem that bad.

strowman is an entertaining personality, and i can easily see him having an explosive and fun match with goldberg. just... no jackhammer. please. for goldberg's sake. give braun more of his destructive personality back and he could have a fun reign.

speaking of mania, if that report saying that edge and ko won't do the matches is true (which i doubt), then i ask that wwe bring the nxt title match on the card. please."
11606,"why is everyone immediately believing this dude? or his, ""sources""?


every fucking time one of these guys come around, they're exposed to be a fraud; these things are literally just educated guesses. you can easily make a case for any of those guys for not going, source or not.

nevermind the fact that this dude suddenly has sources within the wwe, despite the fact that he was literally a nobody a few months ago."
11607,i would rather die. please god no.
11608,"it's so good, even if you remove star wars from the title, it's still an excellent piece of story telling. it's not even the best star wars story out there. (kotor 2 is)

god i love star wars"
11609,empire strikes back is amazing
11610,god no. just let them have a fucking match in the ring.
11611,"we don't know when this virus will end, so there'll be no point in post-poning it."
11612,no
11613,why?
11614,it's not that dumb
11615,"this would be perfect, would also be good for an eventual roman feud between the two."
11616,"i thought there was plenty of psychology and storytelling. they all had a different story. 

rollins had the problem of no j and j security because they were quickly eliminated from the equation, so his body language throughout the match indicated desperateness and almost adrenaline caused out of fear of brock, whom is his biggest problem then. cena was the upstanding babyface, who doesn't back down from a challenge; however, his one problem was lesnar. lesnar was a big, scary and unstoppable monster. he absolutely destroyed cena at summerslam, and at coc kicked out of the last attitude adjustment but the match was stopped by rollins. basically, the whole dynamic throughout the first half was, ""rollins and cena have to take down lesnar.""


 the second half was a continuation of cena and rollins' rivalry. the story was that these two were equals, and rollins without j and j once again forced him to actually use his talents to win. rollins got desperate yet again, so he pulled out the phoenix splash, and just when he was about to win, lesnar recovered and won.

simple but effective story."
11617,"well i mean, it's still a feast your eyes, he probably just did that because walter is a big dude, so kneeing him in the face while you can't really control him would probably end in a disaster."
11618,i take credit for this
11619,exactly lol. representations of raw and sd at the time
11620,"lmfao, i forgot about that. i forgot to mention that benoit was also applauded too, so that's even funnier if you take into account what happened the match before.


that match was the complete opposite of kurt vs benoit, beginning to end."
11621,"walter is not known for no selling however, or at least, indieriffic no selling."
11622,what the fuck did japan do that everyone else hasn't
11623,"wait, why are they doing a show on the 23rd of march there? has the situation over in japan calmed down?"
11624,"do you know why keith lee vs dominik dijakovic at portland was loved? 

because every-time they hit a big move, they were down for a while, so when a no sell occurs, people don't expect it, and are surprised. it was as close as an athletic display could look to a real fight. 

this is just obnoxious and annoying, especially when you no sell a move that looks like it could break your skull. hell, ciampa vs cole wasn't as lenient into no selling as this lmao."
11625,thanks
11626,"ireland and it's government are handling this situation like professionals, so i would guess covid - 19 will calm down over here sooner or later.


by the way, does this mean i got are cancelled and i have to get new ones?"
11627,chris benoit vs kurt angle at the royal rumble in 2003
11628,so your evidence is a fan vote that doesn't really mean much? give more.
11629,"the small guy can't be a star thing was kind of demolished about... 25 years beforehand when bret won the world title from a 500 pound man in the main event of wrestlemania.

i'll mention something clearer to the mind; chris benoit and eddie guerrero, both relatively small guys compared to the rest of the roster. 


don't give that shit lmfao, punk didn't do anything for small guys."
11630,still pissed aleister was injured before this; that triple threat would've been 5 stars
11631,"drew vs brock. 

cena vs the fiend.

edge vs orton."
11632,"wrestlemania by name alone is a much bigger and wider platform than nxt will ever will be, so yeah."
11633,wrestlemania in the pc still feels bigger than nxt in the pc.
11634,"everyone in nxt got a raise, so i doubt he isn't making a satisfactory amount of money. 

again, nxt is a third brand now, so putting him on raw and smackdown will only limit him due to the god awful booking on those shows."
11635,"eh, i think dream/cole should do it; they're both future main eventers, and johnny/ciampa seem like a done deal in nxt.

preferably, both get on the card."
11636,"they don't call people up anymore though; nxt is a third brand, so i don't see why dream couldn't stay in nxt."
11637,holy shit he referenced the heenan call when shawn betrayed janetty
11638,"thing is, he's currently in a feud with adam cole for the world title right now, so none of those would make any sense right now."
11639,why?
11640,they like look a great value tesco brand of the war raiders
11641,i got tickets to the show... now this pandemic is personal.
11642,"he's going to declare a triple threat match where johnny and ciampa have their hands tied behind their back, and he has a sledgehammer."
11643,"they did, at takeover 25"
11644,"chris benoit vs kurt angle at the royal rumble in 2003 was one of the best matches i've ever seen.


the main event triple threat at wm 20 was also amazing."
11645,"i have 8 cats, and one dog.

george is my favourite cat. he's a british shorthair with clouded leopard colours, with a big white patch on the bellyand having stripes for patterns. big and defined face, one of a cat that looks wise but comforting. he's the stud of the car group. i'm pretty sure all my other cats are also british shorthairs.

ruby is the female cat, aunt to george. snow leopard colours, with a big white patch on the bottom and the top being snow leopard prints. very soft and thin face.

archie is ruby's son, exact same colour as her, but bigger face.

jasmine is ruby's daughter, almost entirely black, striking resemblance to that of a black panther. body and face composition almost entirely like ruby's.

rosy is george's sister, with the same colours and body as ruby, but with a mean look on her face. it looks like she is frowning most of the time.


josh is rosy's brother, and george's brother. he has the colours of a normal leopard, he's a big cat, not fat, but big. the same frowning face as rosy.

coco is a cat that appeared on our gate one day, and we kept her ever since. she's very, very skinny, and has a rather circular face. 


lily is rosy's daughter, and i'm pretty sure, josh's daughter (sweet home alabama). she has the colours of a clouded leopard and the same frowning face.


jess is my dog, and a lovely one at that. i'm not sure what type of dog he is, because his genetics are fucked: he has a fox's tail, he doesn't wag it at all and shows excitement by leaning on his front paws. he is a mixture of ginger, black and white. mostly black."
11646,"fair enough, this seems realistic. thanks!"
11647,"it's irrelevant to me, personally. i exist as what my physical form dictates, so i can't really complain. 10/10.


although, being able to lure simps in as a girl would be amazing."
11648,thanks so much! :)
11649,"thanks, i never liked low hung women"
11650,"i want to give up at 30 because i feel at that point, i would be too busy for the stuff i aspire to be.   in fact, if i was able to, i would have a child as young as eighteen, personally,  just to get it done and over with quick lol. i also find 30 to be the age where i would give up on my hopes and dreams if they haven't happened then."
11651,do i ask the girls what size they are?
11652,find a female and reproduce. find another one and reproduce. i gotta keep the world alive somehow.
11653,my guess would be that the government takes a stand to climate change and slows it down majorly.
11654,"ah, lol. i hear masturbating isn't too bad (for me it is) but porn is really bad and can fuck up your perceptions of women if you watch too much."
11655,"i will try push ups; i need to work on exercise too. 

good point, thanks! i will try 30 days and see how i go from there."
11656,"thanks!


also, once every two weeks? you have a lot of willpower, my fellow redditor."
11657,"thanks! it was actually a bit easy, i left all the nsfw subs so i wouldn't get tempted. i did get a bit tempted whenever i saw something on here that was slightly attractive but i kept it cool."
11658,"that's probably supposed to be a joke, but nonetheless, after i masturbate, i get tired, and i don't want to do anything, so i disagree"
11659,"fair enough; you're right. 


however, by ambrose's word, it wasn't because brock, ""didn't respect him"", it was because brock thought that using extra weapons and stuff like that was superfluous."
11660,dark side of the ring probably
11661,lmfao if this actually happens i will lose my shit in a good way
11662,"tyler vs walter is my favourite match of all time, so i feel personally attacked here. /s


i thought that tyler vs dunne at chicago was ok, but jeebus fucking christ, people called it the moty. it was fine, but... moty? hell no."
11663,"it was lol, look back on the threads that were discussing it, people eat it up. me including. 

people were saying it was great storytelling with the way dream locks cole in the cage, revealing cole was the target all along."
11664,i'm 14 so eh
11665,"the weird cage match? that was universally praised, and the ending was considered to be brilliant."
11666,rhea lookin cute
11667,"wow, who knew giving promo time to seth and not having ten million various combinations of matches with the same competitors would lead to actual hype for a match?"
11668,"part one gave a lot of information on how he was before killing his wife and child. they described him as distant after eddie's death, and the day before killing nancy and daniel, he sent very strange messages. 


this was enough to know he was definitely off."
11669,because sting's neck is fucked
11670,how so? the character building has been excellent since the move to usa.
11671,"the wm 20 main event

lesnar vs cena vs rollins at the royal rumble 2015"
11672,i'm glad the phenomenal forearm is a finisher now; so fucking good.
11673,because it would make it better
11674,wait what the fuck a ghost is refereeing the matches ???????
11675,"he didn't have a good match because he didn't want to get hurt for his ufc fight. the match was only disappointing because it was built up to be a bloodfest, which was a mistake. they should've just had a normal match."
11676,"i think velveteen will be a bigger star than him. besides, dream has all the momentum in the world right now."
11677,"sure, but that wasn't because of some arbitrary bs that you guys made up, where you think brock only puts people over if he ""respects them"". brock put over  ambrose.


brock has had plenty of bad matches over the years, but i seriously doubt it's because of respect."
11678,"and you think he didn't put over ambrose? 


he had to f-5 him unto 10+ chairs, ambrose didn't look bad lmao.

you can argue he had one good match with reigns, but the rest were either horrible or mediocre."
11679,"how does that factor in?


brock doesn't book or produce the matches. vince and other employees does."
11680,aleister is. bobby lashley is not a very credible opponent however.
11681,".............................. seriously?

someone, give me a list of names of good raw wrestlers that are currently not on the card."
11682,no it ain't.
11683,"it's this artists rendition of shota acting like a fucking baby, despite the fact that he is a fully grown man. also, shouting ""momma"" is also fucking weird."
11684,shooter calling renee momma is fucking ridiculous and weird. this whole dynamic between the 3 that this artist has made is stupid.
11685,"i think he's amazing in ring, and he has shown plenty of character recently. he's self aware, he doesn't take himself seriously, but he's very aggressive, and doesn't take shit from anyone."
11686,"he was going to become a fire fighter soon after over the edge, i think."
11687,at least this can be viewed in ireland.
11688,mojo is 10 stone colds
11689,"i'm 14, and they're 14, so yeah, highschool shit."
11690,worked
11691,"i don't know, i think dream is better suited; his character and in ring work is better."
11692,"people always say this, but i feel nxt is more character orientated than the main roster by a mile, and is more featured than the workrate."
11693,"corbin is a cunt who thinks he's the best, and the point is that people are standing up to him, showing he's a scared pussy who doesn't stand by his words."
11694,"my friend told me an asian classmate of his was made fun of, and everyone was basically saying, ""oh hey, avoid this girl because she's asian, so she must have the coronavirus!"" as a joke. 


come on, we're better than this."
11695,my favourite national puppy day picture is the last one with corey holding his kittens with no dogs in sight
11696,"didn't they say to people not to be negative about the situation? and here they are, ""ae dub good wwe bad""

we should appreciate both shows attempting to make a good situation out of this."
11697,yes
11698,i think edge or undertaker looked best with the whc
11699,lmfao
11700,aleister black vs johnny gargano at wargames 2. best psychology i've seen in a match.
11701,"ok, this is just getting fucking creepy."
11702,that actually surprised me
11703,that walter match is my favourite match of all time
11704,"i think tyler bate, if not keith lee, should take the title from the velveteen dream after he wins it from cole. he's amazing, he has a character, and he's not as bad on the mic as people usually proclaim."
11705,"i'm not disagreeing; brock absolutely should've won here, and cena winning after his only major bit of offense in the match was ridiculous."
11706,"i wouldn't mind it. rape kinks between bf and gf is basically just really rough sex so fuck yeah, i'll be up for it. 


if she's trying to get me to rape her and we're not bf and gf? fuck nah, that ain't me."
11707,that is called home of sexuality and i do not partake in it
11708,the title sounds like the beginning of a porn parody of phineas and ferb.
11709,nah that gay
11710,agreed.
11711,"am offended by this, and reported to the cia"
11712,"too bad i'm not very skinny and i don't think i'm that ugly.



:("
11713,happy birthday!
11714,alien weaponry - holding my breath
11715,you're an absolute dick
11716,mediocre.
11717,unless they want a fight
11718,"yeah; two nights ago, i got an insatiable urge to watch it. my phone was downstairs and it was 3 am, but i still got it. i think i may have a problem."
11719,"i watch porn on average, about 5 - 8 times a day, and ejaculate the same too; do i possibly have an addiction?"
11720,who.
11721,the followers you have you numpty
11722,"nah. drew won't have momentum by the time this virus has calmed down. let him win it now, we have to get used to empty arenas."
11723,"if she had a crush on you, there would be legal problems involved but it's not that weird."
11724,"playing doom, and waiting until i can get doom eternal"
11725,thanks a lot
11726,i thank you sincerely for bringing this to my attention.
11727,do you think he prefers anal or vagina?
11728,"you're fucking pretty, i'm not seeing it. if i had any advice, maybe ease up on the makeup? i don't know, other than that, i don't see the problem."
11729,"nah fam, do whatever you feel like doing. don't feel restricted by this arbitrary gender shit, if you want to go for it, go for it."
11730,👈😎👈
11731,no problems are seen from my evaluation
11732,i gotchu
11733,good. now send me your postcode and local pizza place.
11734,"thigh pics??? haha, gonna need a little more than that.... ;)


elbow pics and we got a deal"
11735,"i understand what you're trying to say, but even then, i don't think many people think that way, unless you've experienced it yourself, in which case, i apologize."
11736,"i always hear people say what you're saying, but i almost never hear men calling other women shallow for liking typically girly things. where do people hear this? honestly."
11737,don't do that you absolute dipshit
11738,"yes, a vixen video, they're the best"
11739,"not really, i think about it all the time; wish i could do it, but hey, 🤷"
11740,"i tried it, i liked the combat but i personally found it boring; the setting was really nice though, and if you're an assassins creed fan, you'll probably like it."
11741,"we literally are soulmates omgggggg, wanna share more stories of our adventures with the priests????"
11742,"omggg, and did they also also describe you as an angel?"
11743,"of course, you will need to take extra precautions when it comes to this, so treat this virus very seriously, but the mortality rate amount people who are under 18 is laughable. you'll probably be fine."
11744,"omgggggg they did!!!! wow, that's amazing!! such a coincidence! did they tell you it was to rid you of your sins?"
11745,"finally, someone i can relate to, everyone else i told just told me to shut up and be quiet. they were also priests."
11746,gaming
11747,omg wanna be besties
11748,"mum always told me that as well, which is why i have it with my catholic priest, because he told me he knows best"
11749,"i don't know, i've never kissed a girl before, why ask me?"
11750,eh
11751,"focus on other things; have fun with your friends, do more of your hobby, et cetera."
11752,"""no, and it's none of my business whether or not you did, so i'll just leave you here alone you fucking penis"""
11753,same thing
11754,dude i aint no home of sexual
11755,interesting; you make a good point. i will investigate this further?
11756,"well... get one, i guess."
11757,"oh yeah, you're smart"
11758,"you're a fucking genius, how couldn't we have noticed?


it'd probably how pablo escobar did business."
11759,i'm sure there's a word for that... langaugist? nah...
11760,"ah, but where?"
11761,"well, how else do they afford the fur suits?"
11762,"they aren't, they just spend their life savings on the fur suits. it's why they wear diapers, so they won't have to buy toliet paper and go bankrupt.

honestly, it would just seem really stuffy and uncomfortable anyway."
11763,really? how would they react?
11764,"it's not racist, it is slightly xenophobic though. maybe change the ""ling ling"" to, ""some random guy in china"""
11765,"thanks, that means a lot"
11766,good point; i'll stop thinking about it.
11767,isn't quebec entirely canadian french though?
11768,"i actually trying to learn a bit of french, but i'm not very good at it"
11769,"bruh i live in ireland and she's from britain, i don't even know her name, how am i supposed to do that"
11770,yes
11771,"oh, sorry, i'm not good at languages"
11772,stop speaking... chinese??
11773,"what the fuck...??? 


ummm...


si?"
11774,double strap on? si
11775,"not the first time, my female dog tried it, bring it on"
11776,here we go again
11777,"fuck, bonjour was the only french i knew... ummm.... namaste?"
11778,wait what- oh yeah that's hot
11779,"""akin to the skin"" damn, you be rhyming like... i don't know any poets...

would it? i don't know, i don't even remember the feel of hairless genitals anymore, so shaving it would be weird. also, imagine if anyone sees my shaven genitals, they would think i haven't hit puberty in the slightest"
11780,bonjour
11781,"shout-out to op's parents, they the real players"
11782,"too late, pain is my sexual escape"
11783,"very, almost as weird as spelling weird like wierd."
11784,"because it's like feeling your head hair on your genital area, and i'm so used to it at this point that feeling it without hair would be the equivalent of touching a hairless cats underbelly"
11785,i did but they were hairless and it'd be weird having hairless genitals
11786,"i even got a chain on my ankle! oh, it's an ankle bracelet with a tracker that i got with my restraining order..."
11787,"it's ok 😄 by the way, your dad likes women"
11788,"because it would very uncomfortable, and gross. it'd be like having your genitals before you hit puberty, every-time i would look down there i would have never ending flashbacks of being able when i was 5"
11789,what the fuck
11790,and a real jail cell!
11791,agreed
11792,"umm, i'm actually going to have to disagree with you on that, i agree with my existence"
11793,"like romeo and juliet, if it was law and order edition"
11794,that's the plan fam
11795,"exactly! wow, finally understands me. everyone i tell someone this, they block my number, tell me to go away and file a restraining order!"
11796,"if you bothered to tell me what he actually meant, i would be very justified in thinking you cared lmao."
11797,"ok, then why did the guy insult my grammar and not the way i phrase my comments?"
11798,"wow! so you have enough time to type 3 consecutive messages, but you don't have enough time to concisely tell me what's wrong with my grammar?

convenient. definitely not an excuse."
11799,"no, go on. if you go around telling people that their grammar is bad, you should offer some form of explanation."
11800,jason luv's cock after finishing a scene with blacked
11801,name some flaws in the way i form my sentence.
11802,"difference there; big dicks aren't a mental illness, anf mental illnesses shouldn't be an incentive to date someone"
11803,"ok, no joking, anyone who dresses like an emo is the biggest living definition of a degenerate."
11804,bruh you ever hear of paragraphs
11805,the virgin mary had sex
11806,dont chat to this guy he's u/ontherunfromthefbi
11807,"lmfao, fucking christ, real smooth"
11808,"not really, you said in your post title you want to date a boy who's depressed, which would insulate interest in a male purely from them suffering depression. phrase your posts better."
11809,(:
11810,fair enough. i accept your welcome.
11811,"i didn't say thanks faggot- oooooohhhhh no, i'm so sorry, that slipped"
11812,most attention i've ever gotten
11813,yo are you cyber stalking me
11814,and? they'll still make better use of it.
11815,"like i said, if you're already wealthy and you come into a fuck ton of money, what are you going to do with it? the community using it to fund for better healthcare, roads, et cetera et cetera is much more valuable use of your money."
11816,good enough; that is very fair.
11817,yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep
11818,"well in that case, this should help you get to sleep early."
11819,"because more than likely, the community needs half that money more than you do; you're already wealthy.

again, you could make a counter argument for capitalism."
11820,don't bother. relationships come and go.
11821,how would that work? share land and buildings between the government and the community? conflict of interest there.
11822,you don't count your mom as your girlfriend?
11823,"communism isn't bad lmfao. it's not like all people who subscribe to it are dictators. same with capitilism, both are very good"

11826,ok 👊 i win
11827,i have either a high 5 inch or a low 6 inch
11828,"what the fuck, spider man?!?!!"
11829,you too
11830,"well you're not fucking them, are you? like you're not fucking your penis when you masturbate, you're just stroking it"
11831,agreed
11832,ok
11833,"they aren't, most of them are either using incorrect terminology to describe a fleeting moment of sadness, or  they're just trying to get attention."
11834,"i disagree with that, let's disagree to agree"
11835,hugs are for fucking pussies and i ain't no pussy bitch
11836,"well i disagree with you, i like my choices and my person"
11837,"it's not a question of whether i should or shouldn't, it's a question of whether i can or can't"
11838,"well, people can't fuck you from the outside so what's the point"
11839,i like my insides rare
11840,i can see how
11841,good to know
11842,"oh ok.


...


well...

did you start praying to allah when you born out of the womb?"
11843,nothing less but the death penalty.
11844,when i read the first few lines i thought you were just going to repeat the plot of zombieland
11845,"how do you become a muslim at birth? 

when they brought you out of the womb, did you start praying to allah?"
11846,"no, the kid wanted it raw."
11847,"well i got a zit on my dick, i may as well joke about it"
11848,"it's a long story, i went to sunday for church..."
11849,"technically i'm having sex with myself, soooooo"
11850,i hasn't taken a shower in three days when that happened so yeah good point
11851,"no, sometimes i masturbate after eating food"
11852,the aj/cena trilogy
11853,"this is incorrect, it led to revolution, a 4 hour long ppv"
11854,"end of the virus. trust me, the virus is very, very bad. it can spread through the simplest things, can leave horrible affects after people have recovered, so on and so forth. we aren't exaggerating the dangers of it, and it's fucking despicable of you to say that. 


""everything is irrelevant in the ""grand scheme"", unless you know something i don't."" not necessarily, no."
11855,"finally, some rollins vs lesnar love! that was my wwe main roster match of 2019. it was so fucking good."
11856,"again, your families will be fine when this gets back to normal. 

the people who give a shit are the same people as the person from the tweet; entitled and impatient. you don't think i get fucking scared when my parents have to do their jobs where they're out in public? where they have to be social? huh? fuck you. fuck. you. this shit scares me too, in fact, i'm right fucking next to a county with the highest cases. i'm worried as well, very worried, but at least when they have to stop working entirely i'll realize that in the end, we'll all live because of the decision made; when this will end, things will get back to normal.

i'm not saying your family isn't going through a shitty situation. you trying to use your dad to say, ""hey! maybe we should get a date on this"" is despicable and entitled, and promotes panic. we don't know when we're getting a date, we don't know when this virus is going to end, so stop complaining and wait it through, or fight for a thousand a month for all americans."
11857,"again, not the quarantines problem; complaining about the fact that a quarantine is hurting his family's business is irrelevant to the actual quarantine and the much more beneficial nature it will have. more so lack of government welfare towards the families is the problem here."
11858,"i'm not saying he shouldn't be sad over it. i'm saying you shouldn't agree with the woman's tweet because of your dad's company. this quarantine is for the better, and your dad's company is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. 

we don't know when this virus is ending. straight up. so, this may lead to unfortunate circumstances.

it'll be for the better in the end."
11859,and we can't fucking give it. the best thing we have right now is that vaccines are usually fully made in 12 - 18 months.
11860,"not our problem; bring that shit up with the government, this quarantine is for the best."
11861,"who gives a fucking shit? this quarantine is more important than your dad's business, let it kill their business if it means they, and others, live."
11862,"what stakes did it have though? and what consequences?

the match had nothing on the line, it was simply pride. 

again, what consequences?"
11863,"they were more memorable from the moment they aired, and had a better lasting impact on wrestling than goldberg vs lesnar. 

i disagree; i think people will certainly say this was a great match when the topic comes up, but soon forget about it as what it preceded wasn't very good; brock's long reigns, goldberg's endless burial of the roster, et cetera. 

besides, matches are also remembered for their story and i can think of lesnar matches with a better story. his match with rollins at summerslam, his match with bryan at survivor series, his match with bryan at survivor series, hell, the rumble this year will be one of his most remembered matches. cm punk, the undertaker, john cena, so much more."
11864,"i wouldn't rate it 5 stars; if we're not judging it by its workrate standards, (and we shouldn't because that was not what it was going for) then yeah, it's a 4 star match, but honestly? the match won't be remembered in the next ten years, and it will never have the same impact in wrestling history as say, bret hart vs steve austin at wm 13, or shawn michaels vs the undertaker at bad blood.

like i said, i'm not judging it on a workrate merit, i'm judging it on what it's supposed to be, a story, and i can name matches that realistically, have more merit with that than goldberg vs lesnar."
11865,"half of his reigns (pun intended) were under 30 days, so he wasn't ever given the chance to have multiple good ones."
11866,and he doesn't have much of that in the ring either.
11867,"when you completely ignore the context of both feuds and put it in bullet points to make a disingenuous and awful arguement, yeah they did."
11868,"ending the streak would've given daniel mega heat. also, how do you turn undertaker heel? how does his personality change?"
11869,"all of them???? 

all of them were great, excluding goldberg. the two daniel bryan matches, especially the second one, were really good and the miz storyline was great storytelling and character development."
11870,"roman reigns didn't have that bad of a run, and i personally don't count it considering how it ended, kofi's wasn't good, i agree but it was better than rollins', and bray actually had a pretty good run with it, aside from the ending..."
11871,it really wasn't; it was the worst booked world title reign of the last 2 years.
11872,"not cheating at all, lol, i believe if either man won, they would've gotten both titles. thanks, i forgot about that match."
11873,"that's a pathetic list of opponents for him. 


thanks, will watch."
11874,"not exactly a high caliber of opponents for cole, but thanks for the suggestion"
11875,"for fucks sake my dude, the guys yearly salary is 1.2 million. i fucking wish when i'm older and i get a job i come close to getting a fucking 1/6 of that. fuck off with that bullshit, jesus, why bother fighting for this shit when in america right fucking now, people can't take an absence leave because of the current pandemic or else they're fired? or the amazon situation? or fed ex?"
11876,why 2k17?
11877,"jokes aside, i did enjoy the build up for the stomping grounds match, as they actually gave seth a good character, even though the match itself sucked. everything else? don't remind me."
11878,"no, there wasn't. ricochet had beaten every credible mid card guy there. adam cole and pete dunne were the only people before the title reign he hadn't beaten and he eventually beat both. let's be honest, ricochet can't carry a long title reign by himself. the dude has the charisma of a turtle, and his in ring work can't carry him far because nxt doesn't entirely value itself on ring work. the reason ricochet wasn't given an nxt world title run was because of the same thing, he couldn't carry a promo to save his life. ricochet doesn't have much potential, and his value was gone.

title reigns aren't as valuable as you think they are; aleister black, like i said, had incredible storylines and matches afterwards. his potential was extended in nxt as far as it could, an extra 6+ months. title reigns don't mean shit, storylines and matches though? much more valuable."
11879,i doubt that was the reason. maybe it was his horrible booking but eh.
11880,"fuck you, now i want that stable but i'll never get it"
11881,"what's this idea of brock only having good matches with people he ""respects""? 


braun told a story where after the royal rumble triple threat with kane, after he stiffed brock and brock stiffed him back, and backstage they both joked about it and laughed it off. that's respect for a person, but for some reason, brock cannot get a good match out of braun.

it's either the booking, or brock simply doesn't have natural chemistry with his opponent."
11882,daniel bryan and shane mcmahon vs sami zayn and kevin owens at wrestlemania 34
11883,still funny that it wasn't even close lmfao
11884,"that too; if the crowd was cheering hitler, i'd be even more anxious about telling him to go away."
11885,i would replace lin kuei jimmy wang yang with shirai ryu jimmy wang yang
11886,"right answer. if adolf hitler showed up at that point, i'd also be too awkward to tell him to leave."
11887,"the coronavirus is indiscriminate; it gets to anyone, regardless of part ailments.

besides, roman has recovered from it; it's not like cancer would always be there, it happens randomly."
11888,"lmao, i would surrender immediately"
11889,"drew said himself he thinks the song wouldn't fit for his current character, and that he likes his current theme. sheamus is probably throwing a fit though."
11890,*the time has come and gone for words*
11891,"it'd did though; the feud was still on, and it'd be heatless without a title. besides, johnny chasing the title, and finally beating ciampa once and for all while accomplishing his dream of winning the nxt title was the whole point of the storyline. ciampa at every turn would cost gargano at a chance of winning the title. it was heading in that direction, and it needed the title. 

did it hurt aleister? no, he didn't need the title. the dude had the best matches, the best storylines, and because of that, the title wouldn't help him. what would've happened if ciampa lost the match with aleister? what direction would it have gone in then?"
11892,"or give an actual argument.

maybe because it's a compelling feud with two of the best performers on there? 

it wasn't even three years, it's been two."
11893,"ricochet's title reign was long dude, and it had run its course. the fact that johnny had to lightly cheat to beat him doesn't sacrifice shit. aleister black's short title reign was supplemented with aleister soon having one of the best storylines in nxt at that point. 

i know it doesn't, i'm saying dream wasn't sacrificed.

sure, candice was underused, i agree.

ricochet done all he could lmfao. he had a good midcard title run, was involved in a feud with the ue which he won,  had a wargames match, and so much more. nevermind the fact that aleister virtually beat every single motherfucker in nxt at that point. both guys did everything they could."
11894,"fair enough; drew, aleister and gargano all had laughably short reigns."
11895,yay
11896,"tommaso ciampa vs adam cole is the match and feud of the year so far, make me disagree"
11897,how were the stories lacking?
11898,"i disagree, dream gets louder reactions than anyone on the roster."
11899,"the gargano build up to the 3rd match, sure, but the ciampa build up was soooooo good, and the pay off was amazing."
11900,"well... finn balor is the 2nd longest running nxt champion, and he was a babyface.... soooo...."
11901,"how did they sacrifice ""the rest of the card""? 

aleister black beat gargano at wargames, and only lost to ciampa at phoenix because of ciampa very slightly cheating.


ricochet's title reign up to that point was 4 months long, and he and a wargames match before hand. losing to gargano because gargano did something he wasn't allowed to didn't hurt him in the slightest. 

velveteen dream beat gargano for the na title on an episode of nxt.


""sacrifice the rest of the card"" my ass."
11902,it's actually pretty good though; the main event storylines are all amazing.
11903,"i don't see how that makes sense though; the ciampa match had a different story, different pacing, et cetera. then the other cole matches."
11904,"how was ciampa vs cole a match with no psychology?

the whole story of the match was that ciampa wasn't going to stop until he won, and the theme is there throughout. ciampa quickly recovering from big hits, showing faces of immense desperation when cole wouldn't go down either. ciampa going for the title to hit cole with it despite being a babyface was an amazing showcase of character dimension. 

i can go on about the first two cole/gargano matches (the third match sucked though)."
11905,"no, isis have me captured and in order to meet with their demands, i must keep watching him"
11906,"i don't want over the top characters, i want good characters who aren't obnoxiously dramatic. i think kenny's facial expressions and in ring body language is annoying."
11907,"that's fair; vince is a great character, and i think people should study him on how to be a great heel."
11908,vince mcmahon?
11909,"eh, i guess, i still think it's too overdramatic. not really excitement, just showing a face."
11910,agreed.
11911,"lmao, does he seriously do that?"
11912,nxt takeover new york was amazing.
11913,"lmfao, even with the same motion as omega, where he looks like he's having a seizure in mid air"
11914,i just had the image of kenny hitting his cat with a v-trigger and i'm laughing more than i should
11915,"ciampa vs cole not being on this list upsets me. why is mm vs diy on here, despite it being unnecessarily kick out heavy for a tag match with no stakes in the middle of the card, with a week's build, and not ciampa cole? a lot of the matches on this lists are spotfests. i'm sad that the wrestling fanbase are prioritising spot fest's over storytelling."
11916,"can you show me a link of seth doing as such?

even if he did, he's a heel. the dude was guilt ridden after it, but he shouldn't show that in kayfabe."
11917,"i don't know, he had a great long matche with cm punk and daniel bryan."
11918,he didn't go ten minutes because he didn't have to. the match told a great story anyway.
11919,"bruh, brock wrestled for half an hour at the rumble"
11920,"ohhhhhh


oh yeah, i watched all of those, they all had extremely satisfying conclusions."
11921,"bit disappointed that drew isn't on sunday, but hey, he probably still is main eventing, so that counts. it's not like ibushi main eventing wk on saturday was a bad thing, he had nearly as much as a light on him as naito, so hey, this is good."
11922,"""xavier woods vs brad maddox vs alberto del rio"" that's strange, all three of them have tag teamed before, mostly against one person."
11923,"shut up, we're witnessing history"
11924,this is the best
11926,"i do recommend you watch it; it is a very good show, and a really good guy who loves the crowd is the champion right now. really positive and uplifting show all around, and i know you don't like bad people, and they have plenty of good guys."
11927,"well, it's a classic heel way of doing things lmao."
11928,"again, he's a heel. he should be insulted by criticism and trying to make his detractors look right. i don't see how hard it is to understand that lmao. 

imagine if vince mcmahon in the late 90's started saying, ""you know, you're all right; i am a lying and manipulative piece of shit, and i should change my ways"", that would remove all heat from him.  instead, he actively contradicted them and told them they were idiots."
11929,"rb has acknowledged aew before, so nah"
11930,"remember when sami zayn mentioned aew? yes, matt hardy has moved to there now. i hope he's doing alright, as i don't know how that vicious and sadistic attack by orton could ever render him capable of walking again."
11931,"because he's a heel, what do you expect him to do? ""i shall take your criticism to heart, as you all have some thing to offer""? nah fam, he should be acting unreasonable."
11932,"i don't like how nobody who is even slightly lower class can't get tests, but the rich can. still, this is very good, and i'm positive (pun intended) that wrestlemania will go well.


edit: annnndddd they aren't tested, they're medically screened. fuck me."
11933,"because they're rich, and the rich are above the lowly poor."
11934,what... the hell
11935,and walter killing tyler bate with one at cardiff.
11936,"eh, fair enough. i still think velveteen is by far the more over wrestler at the moment however."
11937,"well, no they don't lol. i think it's unfair to say they hate him because he is black."
11938,4.25
11940,what did he say?
11941,"i looked it up, and velveteen dreams searches worldwide are currently bigger than finn balor's. sorry buddy, take a gander again. (i made a fatal error, check edit)

there's also other ways of determine how big of a star you are. like i said, look at velveteen dream vs aleister black compared to johnny gargano vs finn balor. dream and black had to do a lot less impressive shit in that match up and yet, it has some of the loudest chants in a takeover match, and finn vs johnny had to do some crazy ass shit.


edit: correction on the velveteen dream/balor shit, you were right. my bad. it was strange because i looked at them separately and dreams count was higher. still, search rate doesn't equal stardom. velveteen dream is a much more over, charismatic, and interesting character than balor is."
11942,"that's not what it means.

""the explanation of something by a man, typically to a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing.""

this definition implies it can be explained for both sexes, as it says, ""typically"" which doesn't mean ""every"". it also doesn't include, ""assume."""
11943,"it is. it's called explaining something condescendingly, except it's a man doing it. 

it has no real social integrity to it, nor does it indicate any sort of sexist rhetoric from said dude, it can be done to either sex.

there's no point in it. it's just profiling simple shit through sex."
11944,"my dad has the same homophobic rhetoric. usually the best thing to do is ask them, ""can you tell me the sources that prove you right?"". it works on my dad at least, shuts him the hell up."
11945,how so?
11946,"velveteen dream is a bigger star than finn, and from what i've seen so far, better character and wrestler.

watch the match against ciampa at wargames 2 and tell me he isn't one of the most over people on both rosters. he got more cheers and support from the crowd that johnny got during his match with ciampa at new orleans for fucks sake, lmao, and he didn't have to take half the bumps johnny did.

the dude isn't perfect, but when put into the main event spot with great wrestlers, he is one of the best on the planet.


edit: prove me wrong instead of downvoting me."
11947,now you're just saying shit for the sake of it. what's your point?
11948,"she's 13, and judging by her reaction, she knows how serious this is. i don't even show any symptoms and i'm making sure to sneeze into my goddamn elbow. this is pure recklessness and irresponsibility."
11949,neither. a teenager.
11950,"i'm not trying to cause panic, simply calling out an irresponsible twat for increasing risk in her area."
11951,"not my fault you took it literally; i have autism myself, and people are plenty aware of its actual symptoms, regardless of jokes."
11952,what are you referring to?1
11953,uh oh
11954,not every teenager who does a minor thing; every teenager who helps spread the coronavirus? yes.
11955,"well, ok, i am unfunny, yes. 

elaborate on the asshole part."
11956,"it's a joke. basically, i'm saying the populous of florida is stupid. and i know that's not what autism means; it's a neurological disorder in which the person who has isn't skilled socially, and generally isn't very good socially."
11957,florida man.
11958,and they're irresponsible fucking twats who should get jail time for long time.
11959,"i have a theory that florida is a hotspot for extreme autism, and i think it's been proven"
11960,"i have no words. 

fuck it. build borders around florida and let natural selection eradicate it, and i bet in a day, there will be world wide happiness."
11961,"ah, my bad, apologies. still, i knew many people who changed considerably from when they were 7 to even 10, let alone 13. 

a teenager is someone between the ages of 13 -19, which is basically a hot spot for puberty, and and this girl is 13, right on the age for when puberty is supposed to hit. no need to call me a prick, especially when i'm calling out someone who's putting her entire country at risk.

she can be scared, but when you put other people at risk of dying, she's a prick. an irresponsible and selfish human being who should face serious consequences. when you're 13, you're old enough to know you shouldn't be intentionally putting other people at risk of dying. she clearly knows the extent of the virus, so she also knows what the fuck she is doing.

she is a selfish, irresponsible piece of garbage who should be put in prison for the rest of her adult life. what she's doing is more harmful than what robert thompson and jon venables ever did, and they were ten."
11962,"that's fair.

i personally felt that it had no heat to it, because the better and more charismatic competitor, ilja dragunov was not fighting for it, so excitement for me kind of dropped considerably. i felt there was too many kickouts for what it was. the pacing was a bit eh. 

that's how i felt about it, personally, but it's fine if you like it."
11963,"the schools are shut down america, what are you going to do with them?"
11964,"that's fair; i can understand how people could like the dunne match, it was fairly exciting and full of good spots. 


could you tell me what you liked about the walter match though? i can't understand what people would like about it, but it's good to know what they did like about it."
11965,"then that shows you weren't raised properly at all.

i seriously doubt you didn't change at all."
11966,"a teenager is ""a person aged between 13 and 19 years.""

she's a teenager. although, i guess you could call her a child, as one of the definitions for it is, ""an immature or irresponsible person.""

teenagers, while not fully developed mentally, are fully capable of understanding ethics, and what could potentially kill or damage someone. this girl clearly knows the extent of the situation, and yet fucking continues to potentially kill the people around her.

tell me, what teenager do you know willingly allows themselves to run around with, with a potential virus, knowing the full extent of what it could do, and lets it happen?"
11967,"i know she doesn't have parents, my point was to name silly and insignificant things teenagers do. sometimes, we do increasingly dumber shit. 

nice use of ad-hominem, by the way. what do you get out of calling me a ""dumb entitled fuck"", and telling me, ""i life off of daddies money""? it just shows me you're incapable of being civil, and you're ignorant of my situation yourself, considering i only visit my dad about twice every week.

if i would be getting tested for it, i'm taking it on. i'll be scared, very scared, but i would do it; for the betterment of mankind. 

what this teenager is doing is inexcusable. she's going to possible kill and injure people because of her recklessness. now tell me, what average teenager do you know that does that?"
11968,"tell me, how considerably different were you as a teenager compared to when you were seven?"
11969,"i am a teenager. 14 years old. 

the dumb shit i would do as one is not finish my homework; have a fight with my parents over something insignificant; not potentially put my fucking country and it's habitants into serious danger, because while i may be selfish at times, what this idiotic dip shit of a teenager did is fucking mind-blowingly stupid and selfish."
11970,"she's not a ""child"", she's a teenager. she's old enough to know she's being an irresponsible cunt who's putting everyone at risk.

send her to jail for the rest of her teenage life."
11971,"agreed. even though i do think the coffey/walter was worse, toronto frustrated me so fucking much."
11972,"if i were to rate it personally, i'd give it a 5 as well. i think it is worse than the tyler bate/walter match.

i'd give the benoit/triple h/michaels match at wm 20 a 5.5, personally."
11973,"what a fucking moron. seriously, how fucking stupid do you have to be to do that?

how selfish, how morally bankrupt do you have to fucking be to risk your fellow humans such a horrible disease?


arrest her. or hell, let natural selection do it's thing. fuck her.



this isn't a seven year old, it's a teenager."
11974,"i loved it, moty for 2019 for me. what's your worst match?"
11975,"the scale depends on how much i enjoyed a match, and it's elements of psychology, spots, et cetera. so, it probably doesn't end, though there's a godly unlikely chance that it'll ever get ten. it's really just how well a match executes it's goals, it's pacing, et cetera. and that all can change. if there would be a cake, it probably would be 10.

also, i don't know why you're trying to say with that question. if you're talking about the way meltzer rates his matches, i don't like meltzer, nor do i take his opinions to heart."
11976,"well, not wrestling matches. movies and games, yeah."
11977,"who said there was a scale? this is like telling someone who rates things out of a ten, ""hey you fucking dipshit, the scale is 10, not 5""

i rate things however i want."
11978,"there's still a chance to get it at a younger ages but yeah, this is so melodramatic and stupid."
11979,ayyyyyyy
11980,"lmao, nah fam. this is a very serious situation, but jesus fucking christ, this is blatant fear mongering."
11981,"hopefully i'm proven wrong; the us government doesn't make very great decisions though, so i doubt it."
11982,"the risk is low, but it would be severely higher if you have dirty, disgusting bacteria ridden children around each other, and adults.


if we take this low risk statistic too literally, it'll result in unforeseen consequences."
11983,"they must, but will they?"
11984,"thank you for showing me this; i'm under 18 so this is reassuring. i'm still staying quarantined and isolated, and taking every precaution i can to avoid this rather inconvenient disease."
11985,"that'll suck.


at least we'll be alive though."
11986,"no need to be condescending.

this shit has got me scared, dude. all these headlines about it getting worse and worse. every fucking good news headline is met with someone in the comments giving the harsh reality. 

don't call me 5 for being a human and showing emotion; this shit is a phobia/fear for me."
11987,"is this disease world threatening? 

to clarify, is there a good chance this could end the human race?"
11988,that's one good thing that can come out of this.
11989,"those fucking idiots; seriously, how utterly idiotic would you have to be to still prance around like a fucking moron."
11990,what made this woman cheat on her husband with this dude?
11991,velveteen dream
11992,"8/10 overall, great wrestler."
11993,i did. he then kicked out of the last shot afterwards. therefore making it two.
11994,that's what's called an insider term
11995,and that isn't totally exploited?
11996,elaborate on how my statement is racist.
11997,bro im about to go 100 nic
11998,luigi's balloon world.
11999,you honestly think the internet will use that fairly?
12000,we don't even know if the coronavirus will settle in july or august.
12001,"we don't know when this virus is going to end, so there's no point in post-poning it."
12002,he wasn't a main eventer. the dude cut the same promos every week and his feuds were boring. his matches were especially bad.
12003,name some painful parts of the way i form my grammar.
12004,"does virgil not take himself seriously? if so, i love him"
12005,"i haven't watched the replay, but still, a great match. perfectly executed."
12006,"yeah lol. you do you man, don't mind these assholes."
12007,"they told matty smokes to hit the gym once, so i doubt it."
12008,"i don't mind wrestlemania going into the pc.


however, i'm relieved that this is happening. 


this means velveteen dream will get that sweet, sweet pop when he obliterates adam cole"
12009,"he's not a good person, but that rarely matters in wrestling. i would be happy, i personally like him, he's a good character, and a really good wrestler."
12010,lmao a guy makes the friendliest post possible and ya'll are still assholes
12011,"lmao, i'm not the biggest fan of becky but her gimmick right now is beautiful"
12012,i am severely erect
12013,oh my fucking god i am severely erect
12014,stone cold ain't a draw anymo
12015,the devlin side.
12016,"i don't mind; the dude can work a damn good match, watch his match with christian at summerslam 2013, that was so fucking good. also, his match with sheamus the year before was good, except the ending."
12017,"that's the problem; how long do they have to postpone it?


we still don't know when this virus is going to end. it could be next year until it even calms down. maybe two. maybe it could end in the summer, or april.

it's not worth risking."
12018,"i'm slightly disappointed but hey, think about it this way:

this wrestlemania will probably be remembered for a long time for pulling through the darkness, and giving a bit of hope. if drew wins, it'll probably be even more significant because if the context behind this."
12019,kotor 2 is better and i will stand by that till i die.
12020,i want one
12021,good to know; i've already planned to stay inside and avoid non-elbow contact.
12022,"so i'm fine, i just need to separate myself from people a lot?"
12023,"""artist at heart"" lmao"
12024,"and right after that, walter dropped braun in 3 seconds."
12025,every us takeover from 2018 - have all been excellent
12026,"i have been coughing a bit recently, and been sneezing a bit too; however, i feel fine and i'm not heated up. do i show symptoms?"
12027,"ahhh, my bad.

still, the archetype of a demi god who's above all is still there, and a commentary is still there for it."
12028,"you fucking disgusting, dirty whore! how could you do do that to otis, you adulterating slut???? 

how dolph? how?"
12029,"great argument, buddy. is that all you got? you ran out of ad hominems quickly."
12030,"no it wasn't, it was horrible in terms of writing and structure. you can like it though."
12031,i doubt it; the virus is still something to worry about immensely but i'm guessing they'll find some way to contain the infected effectively in  late april - late june.
12032,"yes, he did but it's never said whether or not it's published. adrian also mentioned when rorshach was leaving his building that nobody would believe him anyway. 

jon left because he learnt that there was meaning to life."
12033,it was never said his plan failed lmao. when was that said?
12034,i'm not ridiculing a comic for having good ideals; i'm ridiculing it for putting it in a place where it doesn't belong.
12035,"it wasn't heavily focused on, anyway. and those are doubts and concerns he has with other people, not himself."
12036,"i don't see how they're not realistic, at least in terms of the comic; they're both characters who have human flaws, weaknesses and worries. 

again, none of superman's self deprecating qualities are shown in doomsday clock. obviously, there would be well written comics saying as such, but it's never expanded upon. 

he didn't kill millions of people to be in control of the world; his plan was for all the uniting governments to align and take control themselves. he never wanted to be in control of the world. 

he killed and sabotaged people he knew, yes; but not for no reason. he absolutely needed no one who knew about his plan to come out alive, otherwise he would risk exposure of his plan, which would send the world back into chaos. 


superman isn't a good role model; he sets unattainable standards for morality and ethicality. 

therein lies the problem; doomsday clock risked jeopardising watchmen mixing in with the dc universe, and it turned out badly. it removes all nuance from watchmen."
12037,"the characters in watchmen aren't supposed to be heroes; they're supposed to people with flaws, positives and weaknesses. rorshach is a terrible person, (at least before the prison break) but he's not a terrible person because of an experiment gone wrong; not because he got gross with power; he became a terrible person because of bad circumstances. he's realistic, he's human, and that's why people love him. not because they think he is a hero, but because he's human. 

all the characters in watchmen didn't give up; they all agreed that ozy's plan was for the best, and that they should keep quiet. the exact opposite of selfish; they thought about what was best for mankind, and they went through with it. you could argue rorshach was selfish in his goals, but i see it as him thinking what was the best for mankind.  

ozymandias is the closest thing to a hero in the book. he saved mankind from inevitable doom, while having to live with the guilt of his actions. again, exact opposite of selfish. 



this is why i think superman is a poorly written character, or at the very least, couldn't work in the watchmen universe. i get the point of him, but it simply doesn't work. superman doesn't overcome anything, he simply gets over it by being ""the best of us."" it completely destroys what watchmen did, and it's legacy.

let me call out two specific moments from each book. then you'll see my point.


dan overhears a man talking about hollis, and investigates. he learns through this man that hollis was murdered. hollis, someone who isn't even related to dan, and a person dan only sees on saturdays, was murdered.

dan nearly beats the man who told him this to death, a man who he doesn't even know is responsible for it, a man who only gave him information on it. rorshach had to step in to stop him. dan had a mental breakdown, just like any normal person would, any person could relate to. watchmen set a precedent for books and comics, it set a legacy. now, we don't have the corny and cheesy lines from regular comic books with characters that nobody can relate to, a character that has almost no human qualities to him. the entire point of watchmen was that not everything is black and white, you can't solve things with a superman because... realistically? a superman wouldn't exist. no higher being has the foresight of superman, the moral grandstand that superman has, the kindness, et cetera. this universe makes this message clear, and that was what made watchmen unique. that's what made it excellent. 


situation 2. doomsday clock. 

superman learns that this blue entity has been responsible for all the bad shit in his life, all the suffering, all the death, everything. he sees someone coming behind this blue entity, and it appears to be targeting it. superman saves this blue entity, and immediately puts aside what he told him.

this is why doomsday clock ruined watchmen. these universes were never supposed to connect. the point of watchmen was to make the characters human, make things not so black and white... but now, it isn't that. geoff johns now irreparably damaged watchmen forever with his abhorrent writing and lack of understanding. now? it's... ""you either have a superman... or you don't."""
12038,"that's the problem.


superman can't fit into the watchmen storyline and comics because he is so ridiculously idealistic and morally correct that it ruins the nuance of the graphic novel; what message can i attain from superman being perfect? what is there to be learned? is there any interesting development for him?


by including a character like superman into a story like watchmens ruins it."
12039,"exactly; most of the time, unless some real bad shit is being said, people can contain themselves."
12040,"again, using an example 30 years afterwards isn't applicable, because it doesn't show me he had the same level of stubbornness as rorshach had before hand. even then, stubbornness isn't all that defines rorshach. 


my bad, that was my mistake. i took two sources from wikis and stuff, and i didn't read much of it. my fault. 


however, could you elaborate more on that? because the wiki said that they only discovered he had lung cancer when they went back to hub city or whatever, and it was too late. do you have scans that show otherwise?"
12041,good point
12042,"ah, 52, the comic that came out... exactly 30 years after watchmen? where the question died of cancer, which is notoriously famous for being caused by stubbornness?"
12043,"this promo, and the match were so fucking good"
12044,"velveteen dream, johnny gargano, ciampa and bray"
12045,"jesus, meltzer's criticism of the bray/cena segment is so stupid. how would it be any different if there was a crowd? wrestlers beat the shit out of each other no problem, crowd or not. them staring each other down is supposed to build tension, if they started fighting with no crowd reaction, it'd be jarring and weird.

besides, the only trash bray talked was, ""you care about yourself"", and cena trash talking bray wouldn't affect bray because bray is a forgiving character."
12046,"because aew fans have a higher iq than wwe fans, who are dumb mindless machines /s"
12047,but that's dead
12048,"excuse me? lmao


rorshach's stubbornness is the reason he died. it's the reason why he didn't quickly figure out who killed the comedian. 

moral philosophy defines a person's ideological and philosophical beliefs, which is a defining trait of every human being on this planet. 

his social awkwardness and lack of awareness around people are defining traits; his lack of self awareness is apparent during his visit with manhattan and laurie, describing laurie's mothers rape as a ""moral lapse"", which then gets manhattan to teleport him out of the facility quickly, leaving him none the wiser.

again, illiteracy is a defining trait in someone, and speaks volumes of their mental state. he was quite literate before discovering the dead 6 year old.

his hatred of prostitution comes from a deeply rooted hatred of his mother, which is important to know.


his belief system being uncompromising/black and white is literally spelled out for you throughout the book lmao. it's what gets him killed, sends into an existential crisis at the end and led to him becoming a psychopathic asshole."
12049,"well sure they are; they define who he is as a person. the littlest things are what separates us from each other, likewise with comic book characters."
12050,"things were seemingly fine between him and johnny as they hugged at the end of ny, but tommaso never apologized for the shit did to johnny, however, he never once tried to attack gargano, nor was he ever aggressive to him. johnny is the heel here, for not trying to settle this like an adult and resorting to violence in order the unleash his built up anger. it's pretty obvious, but just because johnny is the heel here doesn't mean he isn't slightly justified; ciampa tormented him.


it's a complicated situation, but that's great. it allows for intricate and deep storytelling."
12051,"""hey what's up guys it's critikal"""
12052,"not at all, no. i wasn't ecstatic about the idea of a sequel but it was interesting, and i was excited for the potential interactions between characters. i actually liked it at first, but then it devolved into shallow and fakedeep bullshit. 

don't be so presumptuous."
12053,i found it; he said exactly what i think. it was so fucking shallow and meaningless.
12054,care to elaborate?
12055,"again, not giving the op an answer to his question is rude and annoying. honestly, imagine if you posted on reddit that you're a programmer and you need help finding programming jobs, and some dick in the comments replies with, ""ummm actually have you ever bothered trying to learn about other things???? learn about tv production and music production, don't be so one sided"""
12056,"well, no, it's just more so that you're ignoring op's question and asking, ""but what about the alternatives :((((("" 

when i make similar posts to this one and someone goes, ""uhhh aew on wednesday nights huh huh"" and i didn't ask for anything outside of wwe, it comes off as pretentious, and doesn't answer the question i asked and dances around it."
12057,shut up and just suggest something wwe
12058,"speaking of him, i got banned for three days for telling him to suck my dick, and i'm pretty sure someone got banned for calling him, ""holo4yearoldlover"", so you better watch around these parts, because holo is a lil bitch."
12059,will ospreay
12060,"rorshach had plenty more to him than being a rip-off however; he had unique traits, goals, backstory, et cetera. there's a difference a rip off and a character which is inspired by another character.

- he is unhygienic. 

- he empathises with children the most out of anyone.

- he is illiterate.

- very, very stubborn. 

- his philosophy is deeply rooted in objectivism and existentialism. 

- he hates prostitutes. 

- he is uncompromising, and so much so, it's to his own detriment: he sees everything as black and white, and there's no in-between. 

- he has no social awareness.

- he's unaware to what comforts people.

- he learns to empathise with people later on in the story.

also, his character arc is different; after breaking out of the prison, he's still his old self; rude, unapologetic, and quite frankly, he was still a twat. even to his former best friend, dan. he constantly berates dan for sneaking underwater and hiding, and dan snaps. he apologizes right afterward, but rorshach ignores it and apologizes to dan; telling dan that he is a good friend, and that sometimes, it is difficult. dan gets this, and rorshach holds his hand out for a hand shake, and dan obliges. it's implied that rorshach held this handshake for too long, which adds to my point of him lacking social awareness. later on,  dan learned thaat hollis mason was murdered, so in turn, rorshach tries to comfort dan by saying the mask killer theory is likely because of this. dan is pissed at first, and rorshach explains that it was meant to comfort him, because it would mean that if the theory was true, dan could get his vengeance upon the killer. of course, dan nearly asks how this is supposed to comfort him, but realizes rorshach was trying to be kind, and accepts it."
12061,no
12062,could you name some similarities between these too offs?
12063,"well, no. like i said, he still feels like his own character, who has his one character arcs, motivations, et cetera that are vastly different to the questions."
12064,"i think that's an incredibly shallow look at it; every character has more to offer than simply being a commentary on comics. rorshach is literally just the question, but in a realistic setting, and he stills feels like his own character."
12065,i'm so confused
12066,he gave it 4. still way too low for it.
12067,this fucking sucked.
12068,"jesus christ, i heard about that storyline and it sounded like the goofiest shit in the world. big time overlapping comics aren't very good anymore, considering how god awful doomsday clock was."

feature them on select shows. maybe once every two raws or sds. there's a lot of angles going into mania, best not to overwhelm the viewer with a copious amount of storylines going on at once."
12089,"while he didn't steal the show that night, randy had the best hiac match in 2018 since lesnar/taker 2015."
12090,"i actually want this show to go on... i know it's not morally correct, but i've never seen a wrestlemania live."
12091,and what's the problem with making jokes?
12092,i don't get it.
12093,agreed.
12094,and why are we paying attention to this one guy's opinion?
12095,"before he debuted, the ratings are irrelevant; ratings always drop as the show goes on."
12096,and you know that how?
12097,where they're doing a very good 712k per episode?
12098,proof?
12099,"lmao, and?"
12100,"well, i mean, she can't; it'd be an unfair physical advantage."
12101,"again, doing something for a long time doesn't mean anything if you write fucking opinion pieces. they're opinions, not an actual profession. his reviews of matches aren't even good, he claimed that aj vs john at summerslam was a spot-fest with no story, and that means he paid no attention to the actual build up and match, which means he learnt nothing over the years.

again, i'm going to judge a person's opinion, not based on experience, because you don't learn anything through opinion pieces, your opinions are generally the same throughout your life; i judge based on the reviewers intent and biases going in."
12102,what will he feed his future babies with then
12103,"i don't see what the problem is with nyla lmao

she's a trans woman, so obviously she can't compete in women's mma. but she isn't. she's competing in a fake sport where you can pull your punches lmao"
12104,"everybody here ignoring tyler bate 


also, daniel benoit has considered training... soo..."
12105,i loved that silver belt
12106,"meltzer isn't, by any means, influential.

paid to do it professionally? what effect does that have on anything? 

again, doing it for long doesn't mean you have more leverage to your opinion, or work; again, he's a shitty writer, but just because he's been doing it for a long time doesn't mean shit."
12107,"again, people like armond white have been around for long and yet still have no semblance of actual critical integrity. hell, meltzer has been a journalist for his entire life, and yet his articles still read like english is his third language; his vocabulary and grammar is so unbelievably tedious and monotonous.

also, ""lol storytelling""? what's that supposed to mean? 

and why are we dismissing brian? he gives his opinions, just like meltzer. he can articulate himself on a higher level than meltzer. why should we dismiss him? it's literally people just giving their opinions."
12108,"so? doesn't make him any more credible that he's been around long; armond white has been around a while now, doesn't make his opinions more valuable. 

the reason i don't personally take his opinions into account is because he values spotty matches over story telling. 


also, plenty of people; brian zane, virtually any wrestler who gives their opinion on a match, cultaholic, wrestletalk, et cetera..."
12109,when has this ever been said? lmao
12110,👻
12111,"do you mean go to ott?

if so, no, i will not."
12112,"appropriate username, u/khabibtime"
12113,how so? if you don't mind me asking
12114,"tyler bate, who's better with promos than people say he is. 


dunne, of course. 


keith lee.


velveteen dream should be the face of the brand. 


finn balor.


jordan devlin! 


lots of them. though, in an ideal world, i'd like to keep ciampa. still feel he has shit to offer."
12115,"you lucky bastard, you got to see that match? 


that was, in my mind, the best match of 2019. change my mind."
12116,"i always see shingo/ospreay talked about on here. can't say the same for okada/ospreay though. 

i see your point, and i agree with it. i still think slower paced wrestling isn't as appreciated as it should be though."
12117,they seem particularly nitpicky of wwe lately.
12118,"fair enough, but i feel gargano/cole is a bad example; it was voted moty on reddit and feud of the year for won.

you make a good point though, there's so much accessible and great wrestling, it's hard to keep track of."
12119,watch any nxt takeover from 2018 to now
12120,"i didn't say aj/joe wasn't praised at the time, i just said it was forgotten, like ciampa/black, for being slower paced. hell, i still see people saying aj fell from grace and using that trilogy as an example. 

i don't remember gargano/ricochet being criticized for that, i remember it getting widely praised. hell, i believe it's the highest rated 2019 wwe match on cagematch. 

also, was ciampa/aleister critiqued for that? because i remember the whole point of the match was aleister taking the far worse beating and ciampa trying to figure out a way to take him down. like the aj/joe trilogy, at the time, it was praised but it was forgotten as soon as it was over, sadly, considering it was one of the best matches of 2019."
12121,"ciampa literally doing anything he could to take down aleister was incredibly compelling, and made me root for aleister. they kicked the shit out of each other."
12122,"one of the best no dq matches in the last decade, roman reigns vs aj styles, had a headlock at the start of the match. being no dq doesn't exempt then from headlocks.

how do all of wwe's matches all have the same psychology though? i found that aew had a much less varied formula in revolution. the only matches to deviate from it were the main event, oc/pac and cody vs mjf."
12123,"i can see how it was awkwardly placed, but i mean, the tlc match was too; it was the tenth or ninth match on a nearly 4 hour show. i found the technical stuff and the spots to be as great as the tlc match (that roundhouse counter to the phenomenal forearm was sick, and the reverse ddt spot was great as well), and the ending progressed daniel's character. 

i don't see how every example i used was a case of bad booking; aleister vs tommaso was an amazing feud, and it was a main event match; the aj/joe trilogy were all in the middle of the card were the crowd were still awake, and they all had great finishes and action; aj vs rico was good too; so on, so forth."
12124,yes
12125,"fair enough, but my point still stands, nonetheless. hell, people attacked the really good aj/bryan match last year for being slow and methodical."
12126,"yeah, especially that elias match."
12127,"the story was obviously, the hurt leg; it gave a bit of tension and drama to the match, and aleister selling it was storytelling and psychology.  also, g/a got involved nearly the whole match, just not physically. again, people are going to say its head canon, but if they didn't immediate attack black at the beginning, that shows aj is confident enough to not use them to their full extent. also, what was aleister supposed to say? ""oh yeah, they have the numbers advantage, i will probably lose""?"
12128,"glad to see some love for black vs ciampa, that was so fucking good. 

i get your point, and i do think aj and black can have a better match. still, it told a story and i appreciate it for that."
12129,rollins can actually tell a story in the ring though
12130,"fyi, i don't even mind matches that are fast paced. ciampa vs cole at portland is my personal moty so far, but that took time to build up and fasten it's pace, and it's spots felt right because it took a long time to get going."
12131,"lmao cool, thanks for telling us"
12132,"nxt takeover portland, recently. perfect pacing and storytelling"
12133,"""the character work is shit"", says the guy who clearly doesn't pay attention to nxt."
12134,"if aj didn't have them helping him at all times, then that kind of proves his point."
12135,i mean 1 - 3 year olds. anyone over 4 is nice.
12136,"jesus fucking christ, “rehab black”? black was fine in the first place, it’s just these two fucking clowns who can’t get a wrestler taking a loss."
12137,"kids are annoying, arrogant bastards who can’t empathise with emotions and feelings."
12138,"not necessarily. in some way, it’s a form of celebrating the fact that i’ve lived this long. like a new year, or something along those lines. 


or it’s just a good excuse to organise something fun."
12139,thanks. time for a little father and son time
12140,"jesus christ, why do ya'll hate sam roberts so much?"
12141,not even aleister vs aj?
12142,links please
12143,"that doesn't equate to ""buzz"", however. so what if allen is better booked, he still doesn't have the same buzz as lesnar. 


also, brock winning mitb gave a really interesting dynamic for the shows, it kept me on the edge of my seat, whether he was going to cash in or not. and when he did, it crushed me lmao, and it made rollins winning it back all the more sweeter. it was a storyline.

brock squashing kofi made him more legitimate again, after taking his first clean loss in 2 and a half years to rollins. 

brock holding on to the universal title for long time makes is for the sole intention of making him lose it all the more sweeter, and it works. every. time."
12144,the gay community?! - aj
12145,so no actual retort to my comment? just pull a r/ihavereddit?
12146,"bullshit.

his feud with goldberg in 2016 was massively anticipated and the squash at survivor series is still talked about to this day. 

his match with goldberg at wm33 pulled a lot of buzz, with people calling it motn for mania. 

come on, if you're on this sub, then a clip of the feud with these two would pop up at least once a month. it's one of the more talked about wwe feuds of the last decade, for fucks sake. 

the fatal four way was massively hyped, and was one of the more main event big money matches of the last decade.

hell, his feud with braun pulled a lot of attention with people holding out for braun to win.

balor, people were very excited for it. 

with rollins? rollins winning the title pulled the biggest pop of the weekend lmao.


his match at ss with rollins gave rollins a much needed boost in popularity. they fucked that over, but it got him over for a short while.

rey mysterio's match was heavily anticipated, and got a positive reception. 

the royal rumble match is considered of the greatest royal rumble matches of all time, mostly because of brock's performance.

and drew? do you even listen to the crowd when drew fucks over lesnar?  or when drew appears? or when drew does anything?"
12147,"nxt having a small takeover energy to it with every show (or like you said, a few times) would help it massively."
12148,"and allen does? 

i already replied to you with all the times lesnar caused buzz so i'm not doing it again."
12149,i believe they said march.
12150,"and 2016 with his goldberg feud. and again with goldberg in 2017. and then samoa joe. and then the fatal four way. and then balor. and then rollins. and then rollins again. and then rey mysterio. and then the royal rumble. and now he is in his hottest feud since samoa joe with drew.

i will admit, his 2018 was complete and utter dogshit, but he still pulled ratings with roman."
12151,"did dave actually fucking say darby allen can pull more buzz than fucking lesnar? dave is a fucking clown lmao. i disagree with jericho too but you can make a case for that, at the very least. darby allen doesn't come anywhere near lesnar.

if that vince/hunter story is to be believed, and i don't count on it being true.. what did they expect? of course aew would have better ratings. i think the key to nxt having better ratings, is to just have it in actual arenas. thankfully enough, there was a report a few months ago saying the big arenas should be coming this month, so hopefully, it wasn't bullshit."
12152,"fair enough. i guess what i was trying to say was that showing off a quality that you're born with is stupid, because it doesn't indicate anything about you. not everyone who brags about being a man, woman, et cetera, is untalented, but it encourages people to think that being born with something is enough, when it truly isn't."
12153,"i dislike the idea of a women's, men's, et cetera day. congratulating yourself with something that you're born with is a showing that you have no other qualities. same with men's day, and any other day. 

same with patriotism and jingoism; it's all just an endless and reverberating echo chamber of something that is completely meaningless. why people give each other pre-conceived notions of greatness based on something completely irrelevant is behind my understanding."
12154,i don't disagree; i think using your own fucking smark awards is a bad estimate of determining as such. i think it shows an unprecedented amount of ago from dave.
12155,lmao nah
12156,"lol, some people actually take these fucking clowns seriously."
12157,"a small, vocal, meaningless sub section of fans."
12158,"or better yet, survivor series"
12159,oh shiz
12160,"jango fett, probably. he is an incredibly strong fighter and expert marksman, who has had his fair share of battles with jedi. however, chief could more than likely beat him."

12162,"yuan from farcry 4? i mean, if she has the same risqué tendencies as she does in the game, then we both win all rounds in some form"
12163,"well, undertaker giving cena props, kayfabe or not, is still a significant moment in getting cena over."
12164,"giving geralt a lightsaber would be useless because he doesn't know how to work one; he doesn't know the forms at all. so luke beats him in the lightsaber category, and with the force? done and dusted.

i don't really know anything about geralt, but i know in his medieval fantasy game and show, he isn't shown to acquire and use a lightsaber."
12165,"first round: all manhattan has to do is think that he wants surfer gone and he wins, manhattan 10/10


2nd round: over in an attosecond, manhattan takes the take.



even if manhattan simply thinking he wants surfer dead and it happening was removed from the equation, there is physically no way to kill manhattan anyway."
12166,"and for drawing jailbait? fucking banging times, i say"
12167,"cool, suck my dick holofan"
12168,"i agree, paw patrol fucking stomp al qaeda any day of the week"
12169,"real dogs except they can do everything they can in the show, including talking."
12170,"they've never been given the order to exterminate hostiles, so i don't see why they couldn't."
12171,ya think? lol
12172,"like i said, if the match through, i believe that the fiend would've had the mandible claw on lesnar, but when he's pinning brock, cole hits the fiend in the back of the head with a last shot, ue drag the fiend out of the ring (bray proceeds to murder them all), and cole pins lesnar."
12173,"i thought if the match went through, they would've booked it as cole stealing a win, which would've been better than nothing."
12174,how so?
12175,"why the fuck would jeff ""my back is fucked"" hardy want to wrestle with roderick ""messiah of the backbreaker"" strong lmao"
12176,"not wrestling, thankfully"
12177,"lmao there was literally fucking one canadian destroyer in that match. also, there was literally nothing but chain wrestling for like 15 minutes, and most of the match was psychology based and call back based. adam cole taunting gargano by taking advantage of his history with ciampa, countering a slingshot spear because he already got hit with one earlier in the match, johnny getting more and more resilient and determined as the match goes on, adam cole going from being a cocky asshole to a desperate mad man willing to do anything and everything to win.

i'm saying this as i re-watched the match recently, and i thought originally that it was, like you said, a spot-fest but it truly wasn't; there was like one sequence where psychology wasn't involved and it was the classic back and forth forearm strikes and moves all over the place spot. 

you must be mistaking it for the toronto match, the new york match won the award. that toronto match was completely and utterly devoid of psychology.


edit: instead of downvoting me, prove me wrong. i'm not saying the match was better than shingo vs ospreay, because i haven't watched shingo vs ospreay. i'm just defending the match, as the guy i replied to clearly didn't pay attention to the match."
12178,"what does wwe owe people with health problems? most of the health problems that arise are none of wwe's fault, most get cancer or have manifesting drinking problems. 


hell, zach gowen, dude was a depressed alcoholic and wwe paid for his rehab lmao"
12179,why would bray do that
12180,"get rid of the women's tag titles.

have less scripted promos.


better writing."
12181,"lmao, are we just forgetting vince offered both angle and hardy free rehab and they both rejected, and that's why he fired them?

lmao, ya'll are pricks"
12182,"nah; the design was clearly unfortunate and it being taken off the website the same day it was uploaded was definitely right, but there wasn't any malicious intent behind it, and it was an honest mistake."
12183,"bianca belair, mia yim, io shirai, candice lerae, tegan nox and dakota kai"
12184,that wwe intentionally made a racist t shirt and waved it about proudly
12185,adam cole vs tommaso ciampa at nxt takeover: portland
12186,wasn't that already kind of an angle? aleister was this undefeated guy and aj even called him out on it last week; therefore giving more reason for aleister to get back at aj.
12187,"braun said that backstage they both laughed about it. shit happens lol, you're gonna be a little heated when someone decks you"
12188,you honestly wwe would drop the angle right now lmao?
12189,"he went along with it and changed his picture to black and white, essentially pushing a lie that defames the company"
12190,keith lee is a moment maker (he's been described by such) and someone who steals the spotlight; velveteen dream feels he is healing the spotlight from him.
12191,"he's telling aj not to go near the ""negr-necromancee"" so wahlberg can get to him first"
12192,oh jeez louise he ain't a big fan of minorities now ain't he
12193,oh he seems like a cunt
12194,what
12195,"i don't get it, what did mark do to the vietnamese"
12196,mark seems like a cool dude
12197,"it would be amazing. the story is there too; keith lee is known as a moment maker, always taking the spotlight, and dream is always wanting the spotlight on him, so naturally there would be a character based feud. the match would be great also, some hope spots for dream to lift lee, both of them competing for the crowds affection, and trying to one up each other."
12198,"i know but the fucking guy ko'd lesnar in one round in ufc, having him in a group as muscle would be a wasted considering his history."
12199,"of course, but i'm expecting lee to take the tile off of dream"
12200,"both are excellent in ring story tellers, but i feel adam cole has the edge on this; he has the best facial expressions, in ring psychology, and can make an injury angle be fun and not a detriment to the match, exempli gratia: adam cole vs johnny gargano at nxt takeover 25, adam cole vs finn balor at nxt, december 18th. point 1 to cole. 1:0

workrate and general in ring work wise, rollins wins this round. he can perfectly pace any type of matches and can do amazing sequences that look convincing. 1:1 

in terms of building up a match? damn, that's hard. rollins and cole have made some of the best build ups last year; the build up to adam cole vs johnny gargano 2 and the build up to rollins vs lesnar at summerslam. both build ups helped the wrestlers, gave them more character and depth (especially adam cole vs johnny gargano 2), et cetera. i'll give them both points here, as they're both excellent at this. 2:2

promo wise? again, both excellent promos, they're also amazing actors who can express themselves beautifully. again, both points. 3:3.


i like em both equally. :)"
12201,it's kind of sad that cocaine is accepted as normal nowadays

12203,cain as a powerhouse would be a waste
12204,"5. because it's goldberg.

4. because it's goldberg.

3. because it's goldberg.

2. because it's a 53 year old professional wrestler completely past his prime and can't even work a good squash anymore. 

1. ooooh ahhhhh"
12205,i don't see how that applies to me but ok
12206,"fair enough; professional was the wrong word for it. 

i don't know, i just like wwe's look better; like you said, i'm accustomed to it."
12207,"imagine watching wrestling and the only thing on your mind is, ""why does her gear show her vagina?"""
12208,oh so she isn't one
12209,"i mean... drew mcintyre vs brock lesnar could be a passing of the torch of sorts, if brock doesn't resign. besides, how many times has roman been passed the torch lmao"
12210,"this is what i have noticed about aew; their lighting and camera work personally turn me off, it just looks... unprofessional. nxt does it better at takeovers than anything else"
12211,"lmao, ""did you think you would get on the show because of the song?""

mjf - ""yep.""


something's never change."
12212,could be nice; japan has a big enough wrestling scene that wwe couldn't damage that much. could also give some underrated japanese wrestlers who i can't name because i don't know who they are some mainstream coverage.
12213,"doubt it; they didn't let the bigger match, lesnar vs goldberg main event wrestlemania 33, i don't think they'll let this match main event."
12214,the fact that probably no show this year will beat it in terms of quality but it's not as good as other takeovers is fucking mad
12215,the fact that probably no show this year will beat it in terms of quality but it's not as good as other takeovers is fucking mad
12216,what score did you give it?
12217,that's not what he said but ok
12218,this actually makes sense; dean wasn't the type to lose easily.
12219,"what the fuck, i didn't need to be sad now :("
12220,"takeover portland's pacing and matches were all amazing; usually with takeovers, there's at least one bad match, but portland had amazing matches all round."
12221,"i think this just shows that most of the young buck's moves are finisher worthy, and they get very tiring after a while when they're all kicked out of."
12222,bring a gun to shoot the coronavirus
12223,"my point is, the takeover event was a little more justified in its kickouts imo, because it was the main event."
12224,"""something involving kenny and paige""


she never learns, does she?"
12225,i know but i can count 5 times where there were false finishes that were kicked out of in the match lol
12226,1.5 stars
12227,"roman reigns

reigns in rome(an)"
12228,"yeah, it's different with some people; i have little to no patience with false finishes for the sake of them, but other people appreciate them, and that's fine. wrestling can accommodate different interests."
12229,"i mean, even if it was five minutes, that doesn't mean you can take the amount of offense darby did and still kick out; especially for it being the second match.

far finishes don't have to make the crowd lose their mind; brock lesnar vs roman reigns at wm34 had plenty of false finishes and in turn, zero reaction from the crowd"
12230,"ah, fair enough. that's reason enough."
12231,gotta save on that cash money
12232,"i think ciampa vs cole benefitted from the fact that it was the main event, ciampa saying that this match was his life and he couldn't lose, and the fact that there were no finisher kickouts, or even that many near falls throughout the night. 

i know there weren't any finisher kickouts before hand but it was a little ridiculous with the class finishes; hager vs dustin had two, one i forget that was a very, very close two and the other was a gutwrench powerbomb. i might be mixing those two up to be separate but eh. 

sammy vs darby was stupid lol; the first false finish was right after taking a goddamn 630 through a table, darby gets hit with the running knee and kicks out. the second was a goddamn top rope foot stomp on the apron and darby still kicked out, and the third was the avalanche spanish fly. i wouldn't have minded these if darby wasn't hit with a 630 to the outside onto a table but he did get hit, so it becomes egregious."
12233,"ok so i did the math, and if he does say this, that means he would've gotten 89 million for the match alone  lmao"
12234,"i don't mind false finishes, i just think they went overboard spot wise, and kind of became very tiring for me. 

it's more of a subjective thing i realize, yes, but if people fall gargano vs cole at toronto overindulgent, then i'm confused as to why people like this match.

again, i'm not trying to attack anyone for their opinions; you can think the match was the greatest match of all time."
12235,"i loved ciampa vs cole too, i'd also give it 5 stars. 

i think the reason i didn't like this match much was because the two matches before hand had a lot of kickouts and near falls, so i was already fatigued from it. which brings me to what you said, that you can't do these matches all the time, which you're spot on with that, but aew already did two matches with a ton of near falls and crazy spots, with no room to breathe."
12236,"i know, and i'm not defaming people for having different opinions, and i'm not trying to devalue everyone else's opinion, but i still don't get it. if matches like adam cole vs johnny gargano are rightfully called out for being indulgent, why not the tag match?"
12237,"eh, i personally thought there were for a tag match that's in the opening few matches; especially when the match before hand overdone it with the kickouts. i think this should've been the second to last match, just to give it a more important feeling, and justification for the kickouts, because i never like starting match ups to get that many kickouts."
12238,everyone here thinks jimmy cornetto has much more influence than he actually does.
12239,"i know, but this match was as indulgent as johnny gargano vs adam cole at toronto, if not, more so, and people praise this match; why?"
12240,there's literally only one 1 star review and one 0 star review lmao
12241,"jesus christ, it wasn't that good; i felt it was overindulgent, too long, and the placement on the card didn't call for it's length and kickouts. 

it'll probably go down anyway; ciampa vs cole was like, 9? then it went to 8.5."
12242,"he probably just meant in terms of social status, he's alone; hell, i wouldn't doubt if he doesn't spend that much time with beth because of his fear of him turning back to his old ways. i think what he meant is, he trusts himself so little anymore, he doesn't even have self confidence or friends, except for his wife, but that's a no brainer."
12243,"two gray men with question marks on their bodies are backstage at aew?



edit: what the fuck, renee was backstage???

uh oh"
12244,"eh, i'd disagree; finn balor vs johnny gargano, keith lee vs dominik dijakovic, and tommaso ciampa vs adam cole were all equal to or better than the matches at revolution; the tag match at revolution went too long, was overbooked for a tag match in my opinion, and had a bad placement on the card. there were no bad matches at portland, everything was exciting and excellently paced, and only one match had a finisher kickout.

oc vs pac was a ton of fun but it doesn't go near the matches i listed"
12245,"the hulkster, brother"
12246,"the show wasn't even better than takeover portland lol. it wasn't bad, in fact it was good, just not a ten"
12247,"well i disagree with you... bitch. /s

in all seriousness? i can't see it. i'm a good example of what you're saying he looks like"
12248,"i think he agreed because he knows bray has unfinished business with him, and cena's entire character is to never back down from any situation. besidesz he's giving a spot to a new guy: the fiend."

12251,"dunne and riddle are a more technically intelligent team; their use of joint manipulation and submission based wrestling gives them an edge over hangman and kenny's rather explosive in ring style. riddle was a former mma fighter and even in nxt alone, he's not someone to fuck with. dunne is also one of the longest reigning champions of the modern era, which isn't exactly something to brush off.

my money's on the broserweights."
12252,"not for me; i feel like they overbook and extend most matches longer than they should be. i probably won't buy another ppv of theirs unless the card looks especially good. just my opinion of course. i do hope they succeed though, as competition for nxt and wwe is healthy and great. it's just not my type of wrestling, i prefer nxt."
12253,what specific time period we talking?
12254,the dream has no memory of that.
12255,the subreddit has fucking links to piracy websites during wwe shows lmao
12256,"you don't have to keep him hot, he already is"
12257,"i really hated that tag match, but if people liked it, then i must be missing something...

how was the fiend/cena angle terrible?"
12258,"jesus, ya'll are cynical; this looks amazing."
12259,"there is more interest in bray/cena than there is reigns/goldberg, i don't think it might've been the case if there was a title involved though."
12260,"ohhhh, i thought you meant right after taking the destroyer. my apologies, i was confused."
12261,"yeah, have cody/mjf and the tag swap their ce and it feels more justified, in my opinion. still would be a little too much for my tastes but it wouldn't affect me to the point of disliking it. long matches should be only done during the 2nd half or 3rd quarter of a ppv, imo.


a match that is much worse than the tag match at revolution though was the mm/diy match. no build up or story, get ciampa kicks out of two goddamn finishers lmao."
12262,"no, no, i'm referring to after the canadian destroyer spot and the fairy tale ending. cole kicks out, ciampa gets up in a minute because of fatigue, and cole latches on to his leg and brings him down for a crossface. ciampa had plenty of time to rest, and the story called for him being more resilient than usual; this match was his life."
12263,"pshh, casual... /s

yes. i do. way too much."
12264,what should've happened
12265,"i was about to write ""interesting"" but then it nearly autocorrected to ""interracial""


oh god oh fuck, what if people will go on my phone and find that oh god help me"
12266,"probably. i'll add ""or more"""
12267,oh yeah lol i forgot
12268,who wouldn't be?
12269,"ah, ok; i never looked it at it that way. i actually did watch the hype package but i didn't think of it that much, my mistake. i understand now.


i still don't like the match personally but eh; thought it went too long and tried to be dramatic. despite the story, it was a midcard match, which shouldn't have had the kickouts it did, and the young buck's offense never fails to annoy me."
12270,"ciampa kicked out of a total elimination, sure, but it took time for them to get him into the ring and get cole to take the cover.


again, he's not doing dives or anything, in fact he gets caught into a submission due to how weak he was. are you just exaggerating or genuinely using fake news lmao"
12271,"well, your opinion of my opinion is a matter of opinion, my opinionated redditor"
12272,"i already told you, ciampa wasn't hopping about, he was in pain from taking the move lmao. 

still, someone breaking up the count is a false finish. 




there's also different contexts behind each stories; nothing about the lead up to the tag match for aew suggested that both men were absolutely desperate to win/keep the titles, so the kickouts weren't even warranted."
12273,did you read the next part?
12274,"20 seconds is a long ass time if you count it down; long enough to recover from getting landed onto what is basically a large mat, anyway; also, when he hit the willows belle, he got up and his face was in anguish and he was using his neck, he was barely able to hook cole's arms, he didn't get enough elevation on cole, and it took him a few seconds to gain his senses back before he could pin adam cole, and there. he also took a full minute to actually get back up."
12275,"i doubt it; nxt rarely does a copious amount of cover attempts, hell, the men's wargames in 2019 had about 3 covers in total, i believe.

even if it did, they're all spread apart so it doesn't make the last few minutes a living hell to go through. besides, some of those were tag moves, which would generally be more hurtful."
12276,the tag team match was utter dogshit in my opinion
12277,"what? that never happened. 

cole only no sold one thing, a powerbomb through a tablet which was absolutely stupid, yes. but nobody won within 20 seconds of taking them.


a mistake that is made among the community is that ciampa no sold the panama sunrise, which isn't true."
12278,"cole/ciampa had three. false finishes don't have to be finisher kickouts, just devastating moves:

canadian destroyer, that was kicked out of

450 splash, that was also kicked out of

the spot where the young bucks but something in which i don't know the name of and kenny stopped the count 

the buckshot lariat/v trigger kickout

the golden trigger kickout

the move right after that kickout

the young bucks kicking out of the one winged angel (done by hangman but still)


and there might be one i'm missing; this was all done in the span of 10 minutes. these are all devastating moves, all of which were kicked out of. that is egregious and every goddamn time they do it to gauge a reaction, the more obnoxious it gets; they abandon psychology for dumb shit."
12279,"question: why did everyone have a problem with the 3 false finishes in ciampa/cole, but everyone is suddenly praising the tag match from tonight to the heavens above when that had about 7/8 false finishes?"
12280,"ok match, best finish i've seen in a while though."
12281,yesssd
12282,"jericho is a big fat smelly cunt

12288,"quick question, so i bought this on fite tv, would i still be able to watch this after its over? it's nearly 4 am and i should get to sleep but i don't know what to do"
12289,and the tag match wasn't?
12290,"0.5. wardlow didn't hit his finisher on brandi. /s


jk, this was the best match of the night by a mile, i loved this. 4.75 stars, absolutely brilliant showcase of psychology. my only problem? brandi and arm distracted from it imo."
12291,"""i didn't mean to be a richard"" lmao i love you jr"
12292,i love this already.
12293,"so... me expressing my opinion makes me a troll? jesus christ...

i'm not even a fan of cornette, dude. why does it bother you so much that i didn't like the tag match?"
12294,"in my personal opinion, i thought the kickouts in the darby/sammy match was too obnoxious and stupid; nothing about the story or psychology called for it and it annoyed me. 

for the tag match? the tag match started out great with the amazing psychology and everything. then....it went downhill. the match lost all semblance of psychology, the 7 or 8 false finishes were the most obnoxious examples of falses finishes i've ever seen in my life; it just got ridiculous, and the story didn't call for it. people complained about ciampa/cole, when that only had 3 false finishes, two of which were delayed by the fact they couldn't make the cover quick enough."
12295,this match will be fucking great. i really like cody and mjf
12296,"match of the night so far. 3.5 stars.

also, that's the... 3rd match of the 4 so far tonight that a finisher has been kicked out of.


edit: jesus, lot of downvotes. why?"
12297,what's nyla roses finisher?
12298,no
12299,"that tag match was awful, not much to follow"
12300,did he just count three twice?
12301,that match sucked ass
12302,"lmao yeah, 2 stars is average so i thought it wasn't accurate."
12303,"this was far, far worse than ciampa vs cole in my opinion. that had... 3 false finishes? all apart from each other, and two of them took time to get the cover on. this had 4 or 7?"
12304,"that was god awful. 1.5 stars. it started off great and then they started jerking themselves off and saying ""hey we have kickouts too guys"" it's like they saw ciampa vs cole and went ""how about we do this but tenfold"" . fuck me.


the just gave up on psychology halfway through and started having a million kickouts"
12305,fucking end jesus christ you self indulgent assholes
12306,this match is officially garbage now
12307,"this was good at first but jesus fucking christ, this is just stupid now."
12308,"yeah; a rare example of multiple kickouts working is ciampa vs adam cole, but most of the time, it's too much and doesn't play into the story."
12309,"how though? this isn't a nitpick, this is a big issue"
12310,"of course, but i'm not asking for every match to be hard hitting and competitive, just this match more so. 

there's no reason darby should've been kicking out as much as he did."
12311,goddamnit
12312,"i don't know, people always cheer dumb shit like that; people cheered lio rush no selling a powerbomb from the top of the ladder through a table. 


i don't think it does anything for them long term; why couldn't they have just had a competitive, hard hitting match? it's not that hard."
12313,stop what?
12314,kenny's theme has grown on me
12315,"dustin isn't fucking stupid lmao, there's literally no way he would intentionally assault a women live"
12316,"i actually really like their acting and characters, but as wrestlers, i get annoyed watching them. to me, it looks too choreographed and lack of a hard hitting style imo."
12317,"i really, really don't like the young bucks.



their theme is absolutely fucking banging though."
12318,"still, it's a midcard match, there's nothing at stake, darby took a 630 on a fucking table, a top rope stomp, and a spanish fly, that's just stupid. i don't mind a spanish fly kickout, but the other two are a little egregious."
12319,"you're not wrong, in fact he shouldn't have kicked out of that at all."
12320,"why the fuck did darby kick out of that much? i know he's resilient but it just got stupid, this is a fucking random midcard match with little to no heat in this rivalry lol


2 stars"
12321,i know but this is just ridiculous
12322,"ok, seriously, there's no reason darby should be kicking out of all this"
12323,"oh my fucking god, if darby kicks out of this"
12324,"ok, a 630 through a table should result in darby being dead for the rest of the match and should be instantly pinned"
12325,guevara looks like young steve o. does stupid shit like him too.
12326,"ok that's it, darby's done"
12327,"ah, right"
12328,in what situation would you get a skateboard thrown to your head
12329,wait is this a stipulation match
12330,that was awesome but fucking retarded
12331,"lmao, why would they get triggered over this lmao"
12332,"lmao, what did you say when kurt tried to rape booker's wife?

""guys it's just edgy lol get with it pussies"""
12333,"if we don't have regal shouting war games, then it ain't war games /s"
12334,"obviously, it was scripted. 


in kayfabe? still gross."
12335,"i know it was scripted, i'm talking kayfabe wise"
12336,"eh. lot of punch/kick in the middle. very forgettable, and it was way too long. 2.5 stars."
12337,"aew has a problem with making the men's matches way too long, and nxt has a problem with making the women's matches way too short."
12338,:'(
12339,eh. very forgettable and mediocre.
12340,"oh fuck, hager really launched himself into the atmosphere"
12341,"technically, it is"

12352,humberto will prove you very wrong rb... just you wait.
12353,ajay ghale is a well written protagonist and i don't see why people don't believe that
12354,"look, i'm not asking for much, could you provide a link saying so or something? otherwise, it just looks like you're deflecting through calling me a racist. 


i'm only asking for it because i followed the entire jordan myles t shirt controversy, the whole way through, and i never heard what you said he claimed."
12355,"again, i'm not saying that i support it; i'm only saying we shouldn't throw around the word racism when we look at the context, which was that the design was unintentional and removed from the website a whole day after it was released. 

again, i'm gonna need some evidence on the whole ""jordan told them not to put it in a black shirt"" thing."
12356,"i'm only defending it based on what i know. again, could you send me anything that confirms jordan said before the shirt was made to not make it black? because i haven't heard that until now. also, i don't remember anything saying that they couldn't release it in black.


also, could we please not get into ""you're racist!"" shit throwing? i just want to have a nice discussion, i don't want any bad blood or accusations thrown out of the gate based on... nothing.


also, i never saw anyone say that during the controversy."
12357,iron shiek shoots on the coronavirus - wrestletalk tomorrow
12358,"quick, someone call 911, this man is having a seizure!"
12359,"most t shirts for the nxt undercard came in multiple colours. it was the undercard of nxt, they weren't going to be out much care into the design. even from a design perspective, the logo is incredibly bland and boring. the design crew just went through the motions.

like i said, it was removed a month before anything came out about it; wwe removed it without public pressure. they knew what happened and they took care of it, so there was really no point in myles' rant, in my opinion.


have you got any sources as to jordan saying that beforehand? i have never heard that up until now, and i wouldn't believe him if he said it now, considering that would've been valuable information to say during the meltdown."
12360,"it wasn't intentional racism though, that's why i think we should let it pass as the mistake it was. don't forget, ach approved the design too. 

i think we should all calm down about it; it was over and done with before ach even talked about it. i'm sure wwe won't let a mistake like that pass again, if there's one good thing that came out of jordan's twitter meltdown."
12361,"the design was unfortunate, yes but still, ach reacting to a shirt that was removed, a month before he complained about it, for the exact thing he was mad about was hypocritical. the design was purely accidental and everyone was at fault there."
12362,"believe in what? i believe that they're prestigious in terms of the storyline, and as such, i think there's value in them. 

again, that's not the story of drew vs lesnar."
12363,"my apologies, my description was vague; andrade is not concerned with matters of anything outside of matches, as that's zelina's thing. he's rather apathetic to it all, he doesn't care that much, he just wants to have matches and be commanded by zelina."
12364,"do you think they're acknowledged as fake in the storyline? fuck no, it's still regarded as important and the wrestlers want it. 

again, i did point out a storyline."
12365,"angel is a charismatic, ladies man who's a bit slimy. humberto is an angry and aggressive person intolerant of any bullshit coming his way. andrade simply let's zelina do the talking, as he is more so focused on the competition and winning. they all have more characters than rey lmao."
12366,"isn't the title enough of a fucking reason???? again, i pointed out the character dynamic but you're intentionally ignoring it because your point is fucking moot."
12367,"that's what i mean by business savvy. i know andrade got suspended, i'm speaking kayfabe wise, zelina's business savvy and charismatic ways got her to get angel to come over to raw. it also she's her as clever and cold, as angel is humberto's cousin."
12368,"there's truly no point anymore. you're so obsessed with finding flaws that it's not even flaws anymore.


most starts of feuds are irrelevant to characters. austin wanted to fight a legend, so he called out bret hart. you don't need a shakespearean level character for something like that to happen. the two are interchangeable. what makes the feud different is what they do with it afterwards, and i feel they're making it engaging with the character work and history at play."
12369,"not particularly, because zelina is more slimy, business savvy and intelligent than other managers."
12370,"brock lesnar's complete and utter dominance and superiority is unique, and his heel character is certainly a lot better than others, so yeah, it's creative. 


every. single. fucking. feud. is. a. fancy. way. of. saying. they're. fighting. each. other. 

now you're not even arguing, you're just straw-manning and simplifying the story down to its basics because you know you're wrong and you're straw-manning as a result. if you're not going to offer anything more that goddamn strawmen, we may as well stop here."
12371,that wouldn't work because of andrade's history with zelina.
12372,"again, not interchangable because both men had beef beforehand with humberto beating andrade and all..."
12373,it means she is yet another obstacle the babyfaces have to go through. it's an interesting dynamic.
12374,"nothing about lesnar's or drew's character gels in anyway?

jesus christ.... drew mcintyre absolutely failed in his first run, and he was supposed to be the chosen one; he failed, and he was released. his dream had been crushed, every thing fell down around him... the only thing left to do was get back up. and he did. he came back better than ever, more than determined than ever, and his dream? win the world title and main event wrestlemania. the only person standing in the way?

 brock. lesnar. lesnar has crushed the hopes and dreams of nearly everyone. kofi, ricochet, rollins, reigns, goldberg, undertaker, so many people. he only lives for himself and will crush anyone standing in his way. he has no consideration towards feelings, he doesn't play mind games, he never compromises. he has effortlessly destroyed cena, kofi, ricochet, rollins, et cetera. this is why he is the best obstacle for drew; this is drew's dream, what he worked for his entire life, but lesnar doesn't care in the slightest. he doesn't know what drew went through because he never experienced what drew went through, he never had to work that hard to get to the main event, it was never a life long grind. he is the perfect anti-thesis to drew.

in terms of actual personality? they're both confrontational and fearless, regardless of alignment. it could make for some intimidating segments. they're also both fairly goofy and self aware at times."
12375,"i mean... her absolute unwillingness to risk her body and career to help andrade win his matches more than any other manager speaks for itself.


the character? andrade is the cocky rookie who thinks he is better than the old, humble veteran."
12376,"ok??? doesn't change the fact that humberto has reason to do it, and that it makes complete sense storyline wise. also, andrade was the one who kayfabe injured humberto by driving him into the concrete, so it wouldn't make sense if anyone else did that to andrade."
12377,"brock is the final boss of wwe, the toughest there is. drew has waited so long to prove himself, he has come so far, and the threat level of lesnar makes this match more legitimate than if it was ricochet, or even roman. drew is desperate to prove himself, he has waited so long to prove himself, and brock is the only thing he has left to prove; beat lesnar, and he redeems himself."
12378,"this is a fucking midcard feud, it's your fault if you're expecting hbk/hhh levels of continuity and storytelling. 

they had a heated rivalry which had andrade fucking rey over at every turn by using zelina, who's unique to andrade. andrade gave rey many unfair losses, andrade took the us title from rey, and when rey had a chance of winning it back, zelina ruined it all. there."
12379,"i already replied to you about why you couldn't replace anyone in the four way with each other so i won't bother here. 

drew mcintyre's story only works for him because he as the one who was the chosen one, the one who fell so, so far from grace and got released, and now, he has come back better than ever, better shape than ever, and he's going to redeem himself for messing up on his first run.


the randy storyline works best with randy because nobody has a history of injuring and nearly killing people like him. edge's history with the neck and eliminating orton from the rumble also plays into the storyline.


bray and cena's storyline is so blatantly obvious as to why they can't be replaced, so i won't bother."
12380,"no, you couldn't. you couldn't replace rey with anyone else because nobody else has the history rey has with andrade. humberto is cousins with garza, with leads to a bit of sibling rivalry, almost."
12381,"like i said, they aren't fighting each other for the sake of it; all of them have problems with one another that arose from their history together, or their current problems with each other. humberto didn't injure andrade because he felt like it lol."
12382,"i never said it was two guys fighting for the sake of it, that wasn't my point; if you simplify it down like you did to every goddamn example of a feud that everyone is giving to you, it literally just is two guys fighting each other because they both have a problem with each other. that's what nearly every feud in pro wrestling is, and the fact that you're complaining about the unoriginality of storylines nowadays when that's what all storylines are at the end of the day. 

let me simplify bret vs austin down like you did the current 4 way lation situation going on raw right now;

wrestler 1 had a problem with wrestler 2. wrestler 1 and wrestler 2 have a match. wrestler 2 gets mad wrestler 1 screwed him over. wrestler 2 gets less popular while wrestler 1 gets more popular. wrestler 2 gets mad about this. turns into a bad guy.

see!? you can make any storyline sound uninteresting if you intentionally make it that way.


there's a reason to why nearly every feud happening right now, and you're blatantly ignoring that."
12383,"that's my point; you can easily strawman every single goddamn feud in pro wrestling to ""these two men want to fight"", when in reality, that's what pro wrestling is, but when you intentionally ignore the steps that make it as such, it's an easy strawman to use. 


those two feuds were both ""two men wanting to fight each other"" if you try to devolve and simplify them, which is what op is doing in order to create fake outrage or something."
12384,"for every major title and storyline? sure, they'll find a way. the sd tag titles actually have something going on with the usos and the new day, not much has to happen, just that. randy orton vs edge will probably get the explanation this week, and 5 weeks is enough to fill in that hole. drew vs brock has 5 weeks to build, which should be more than enough, considering the story and groundwork is already there. cena vs the fiend has enough backstory behind it that 5 weeks of build will be packed with story."
12385,"oh god, people having a problem with each other and wanting to fight each other??? in pro wrestling?!!? the horror! 

it's still a storyline, with revolving parts and consequences. just because that the whole basis of pro wrestling is ""two guys want to fight"" doesn't make it less so."
12386,"some of the best mania storylines can be devolved and strawmanned into, ""two men who want to fight each other""


austin vs bret? austin wanted to fight bret. 

hogan vs andre? andre wanted to fight hogan. 

undertaker vs edge? undertaker wanted to fight and take down edge.

benoit vs michaels vs hhh? benoit wanted to fight hhh, but shawn also wanted to fight hhh, so in turn, they all decided to fight each other.


shawn michaels vs the undertaker? shawn wanted to beat the undertaker more badly than others."
12387,"without explanation?

humberto has a problem with andrade because when they have fought, andrade has fucked him over in nearly every single way imaginable, and as such, he fucking kayfabe injured him out of anger. as a result, zelina brought angel garza, a notoriously slimy individual who had a bit of beef with humberto in the past. andrsde has now become allies with angel, because he's fighting the guy who injured him. rey wants to help humberto, because andrade is his enemy, and as they say, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"""
12388,"5 weeks is plenty of time to tell a story. besides, cena vs wyatt writes itself, so does goldberg vs roman."
12389,it's poor storytelling if you have to rely on a medium outside of your own to actually convey a story.
12390,"difference is, being the elite is a goddamn web series and not a major episode of the tv show it's a spin off of. 

like i said, the mcu is basically one, soild tv show, and every episode is integral to the plot. that's what is great about it, it's a nice, contained package where i don't have to read or watch anything outside of it that i either don't have time to watch, or just not entirely interested in. 

being the elite is a web series to a 2 hour long tv show. i shouldn't have to waste my time watching 50 10 - 20 minute long episodes to even understand what is going on within the other two hour show. it's way too much time and effort."
12391,"simple; promos. backstage segments, or just use the shit they record for bte and put it on dynamite. with all the episodes of dynamite, i seriously doubt they couldn't have fit a backstage segment where hangman apologizes lmao. you act like these have to be 20 minutes, but all they have to fucking be is 3-5 minutes of the elite talking backstage every once in a while.


no, it's not like a marvel movie; marvel movies are like episodes of a tv show, very long episodes where every one is as important as the other. i'll give you an example, imagine if the only scenes thanos appeared in were the scenes where he collected the infinity stones, and he's given little to no characterisation. also, remove all semblance of his relationship with nebula form previous movies, and all of the scenes he has with her is confusing because there's clearly tension between them but it's never explained: and then marvel reveals in order to actually learn about thanos' character and why we should care about him, we have to read a 100 part comic series explaining everything about him bit by bit, and giving him development that is integral, why he wants to eliminate half of the universe, et cetera, in order to understand the movie and his relationship with gamora. it'd be fucking annoying and inconvenient, and a sign of laziness on terms of storytelling, which is why marvel didn't do that. but the elite aren't very self aware, so they still do it, completely ignorant to most people's thoughts, which is, ""i don't care about this low budget tv show called bte, i just want to watch dynamite."" 


what's so hard to understand about that?"
12392,"how?


he explains away the goldberg loss, states his goals and leaves it at that."
12393,"""bray wyatt buries enzo amore and simon gotch"", on recommended for eternity"
12394,"wow, a wrestler was promoting and adding story to his program, what a shock."
12395,and where did you get the idea he would?
12396,"yeah, but it's never explained why unless you watch being the elite. for example, the moment when hangman was on commentary; if you never watched being the elite before hand, you'll be asking yourself, ""why doesn't he celebrate with the elite?"" in fact, if you remove being the elite from the equation at all, then it just looks like one set of contrivances over another as to why they're not getting along. again, if you don't watch being the elite, you'll be asking yourself, ""why are they not getting along?"" the entire way through, and when there is a reason, it's some stupid bullshit like, ""oh hangman accidentally stepped on my foot"", and that ain't engaging. being the elite has engaging shit but i don't want to spend another fucking minute watching another goddamn wrestling program.


edit: instead of downvoting me, prove me wrong."
12397,"imagine having all of this not on the major television show that the storylines are happening on, that would be ridiculous...

jesus christ, could they actually incorporate more of this into dynamite? if you literally only watch dynamite, then you would be absolutely baffled as to why hangman is suddenly a pissy dude and why he's distancing himself from the elite. i follow aew lightly, and i got so confused as to why hangman was suddenly drinking beer a lot and why people were saying one of the elite were going to turn heel on each other, when none of the highlights really showed anything lmao."
12398,"yeah, just buy it on fite and you can watch it tomorrow; i was too tired to finish full gear so i just watched jon moxley vs kenny omega the next day."
12399,"super show down?

of course he did; it made the shock factor of goldberg winning that much more impactful, not good impactful, mind you."
12400,"yeah, hopefully jon's harder hitting style will be more compatible with jericho than it was with the ambrose character."
12401,where?
12402,"i never said he didn't care about the belt, just not enough to put effort in."
12403,"bray explained it; goldberg was irrelevant, he didn't care if he lost or not, so he didn't put in any effort."
12404,"some of the sequences from the adam cole vs johnny gargano rivalry are similar to this, with better psychology than this. angel garza and lio rush do sequences like these too."
12405,"oh god, hager and spears? really fucking over nxt lol"
12406,no
12407,"the reason nxt never got any emphasis was because it was actually losing wwe 11 million a year; they only kept it because it was a developmental show, and the money lost would be remade by the stars made in it. now, when it is making them money, i don't see why they would get rid of it, especially if the report that it's moving to big arenas in march is believed to be true."
12408,"make andrews, i want to stay; they gave the sws some time on nxt us, and i hope that translates to a full time schedule with them."
12409,my local bumfuck indie show
12410,"""i mean, the third brand thing is a reaction to aew, right? it's there attempt to fight back against the new competition by trying to make nxt more important in order to steal eyes away from dynamite. and sooner or later, this ""war"" is going to end, at which point, well...""

i find that to be very unlikely; nxt is making wwe a lot of money right now, and if i'm being honest? i don't think this war will end in even a decade."
12411,"and you think that, why?"
12412,"i wouldn't worry about either of them, nxt is considered a third brand so i can see them both staying for a long time. would be cool to see them in aew though.


would you trade anyone from aew to nxt?"
12413,"ligero, a-kid, et cetera, any small guy who they do nothing with"
12414,"but, bray isn't nxt..."
12415,"i disagree; seriously, nobody is interested in the match for pac, if it was any other heel, it'd still be hyped. pac is in a terrible position right now."
12416,not related but ok
12417,and? does it stop him having a good match?
12418,because he is a 53 year old
12420,"yeah, thankfully enough though, wwe have really shortened their ppvs to about three hours maximum; hopefully for mania, it's three and a half or four."

12425,"my bad, i'm stupid.


also, no, it wasn't. wm28 and wm 30 are shows where there are no part timers involved."
12426,bray's character work and heelish antics helped build the match.
12427,"he had two great matches with daniel, and a fun match with the miz."
12428,"the fiend worked, i don't know what you're talking about lol."
12429,why?
12430,"no, he would be saying, ""hey i don't believe in the flat  earth but.... i mean... it has some of the right ideas.... 🥴"""
12431,"bray wyatt vs randy orton at wm33 was between two full timers. aj styles vs shinsuke nakamura at wm34. kofi kingston vs daniel bryan at wm35.


c'mon, it's not that hard."
12432,"lmao, shut the fuck up dude, jericho wasn't a part timer, he worked every single goddamn show from the rumble onwards. i'm also pretty sure his return lasted for two years, so nah.


that would be like calling finn balor a part timer because he took a two month break and returned to nxt."
12433,seth is 34 i think
12434,"jesus, that's a lot of straw-mans that aren't true"
12435,"seth rollins also beat cena's ass clean as a whistle, only after winning an incredibly competitive match with roman reigns.


roman reigns also decisively beat cena. 

finn balor pinned john in a fatal 4-way."

12438,depends; i can easily see them milking it for 15 minutes.
12439,"well no, because now we realize the fiend can be defeated by one glorified suplex"
12440,"i'm still pissed that they wasted aleister blacks first and last nxt title defense at a takeover against lars fucking sullivan. seriously, that and lee gets fed to him; what do they see in lars?"
12441,"i can deal with a normal panama sunrise kickout, but getting a flipping piledriver from the top rope should always result in a pin, no matter what. i get the trope but there is times where there should be a breaking point."
12442,"well yeah, they didn't kick out of any finishers which was a good thing; still, with the amount of damage cole took in that match, it was absolutely ridiculous that he kicked out of a tope rope canadian destroyer, much less anything else he kicked out of in the third fall."
12443,"ciampa kicking out as much as he did was in character; he's a resilient guy, and the story called for him to kick out as much as he possibly could. cole didn't kick out of much, only one finisher and it took ciampa a long time to get the cover on him.


adam cole kicking out of a top rope canadian destroyer after:

taking a top rope sunset flip powerbomb onto multiple chairs

getting hit with a million kendo stick shots

getting backdropped onto a table and destroying it

getting lawn darted right into a chair

and getting speared right through a barricade 


this was absolutely ridiculous and didn't make sense within the context of the story.


the story in question didn't have cole yearning to win the match, only being an arrogant cunt who thought he was invincible."
12444,yay aleister is a draw
12445,"ciampa/cole deserved that rating; maybe it did get a little overblown, but at the very least, it was consistent with the characters unlike nxt takeover: toronto 2019's main event. the only major problem i had with that match was the no sell of the table spot, that was fucking horrible. otherwise, 4.75 stars."
12446,"fuck you, batista bomb"

ricochet (face)

ec3 (face)

ciampa (heel) 

gargano (heel) 

riddle (face)

tyler breeze (face) 

pete dunne (face)

roddy (heel)


6/10 of his major feuds have been against faces. he's just over as fuck. 


i don't see how dream is acting like a creep; he hadn't actually approached roddy's wife."
12452,that's an unbelievably retarded take.
12453,"no, it doesn't."
12454,what does she like?
12455,"what defines weird people? the only truly weird people are schizophrenics, but we don't need to keep them in order."

12458,"how is jerry a dick? sure, he can be obnoxious and stubborn sometimes, but he can be nice. 

rick is just a selfish, arrogant, asshole."
12459,"how is dream going after strong’s family? he is more so playing on the fact that strong has a family to piss strong off, otherwise he has made no advancement towards strong’s family. it’s the equivalent of “i fucked your mom” when you were a kid.

dream has always been an asshole, that’s what you and dave are ignoring. who cares if he decided doing this?"
12460,"people always think about the story, otherwise people wouldn’t be cheering dream, and wouldn’t be booing roddy."
12461,"imagine watching for long enough to know dream's character from beginning to end and getting mad that dream is acting like his character. 


fucking hell lmao, does dave even pay attention to character development? or storylines? because roderick has done much, much worse."
12462,because rick is a gigantic cunt who nobody should admire
12463,that's not what i said; when has dream actually confronted her and her son? when he has intentionally tried to talk to her?
12464,"what's dream doing to his family? he's not showing up personally to their home or anything, he's just being a cunt to her husband."
12465,"if roddy nearly killed a guy who's notorious for playing mind games with his rivals.... like, what else would you expect?


besides, roddy deserves it"
12466,"roddy nearly killed dream. completely justified of dream to do that, i don't fucking care if my brother did the things roddy did to dream, i'm gonna fuck with him as much as i could."
12467,roddy when he nearly killed dream but k
12468,"difference is, that would be out of character for those faces, and it depends on the situation that brought them to say that.


velveteen dream is definitely the type of character to do that shit. he is, by nature, a dick, that people like. he damn near cheated to win his match with breeze, and he stole a win of roddy in toronto, now this. the things ue did that you presented would also be fair game with dream

dream also clearly ain't trying to commit adultery, he's just fucking with roddy. that's dream's mo, he fucks with rivals through mind games. 

the point isn't to make dream look like a babyface, because dream isn't a babyface; he's just a face."

12481,:( you will regret this
12482,"people did ask them what the story was, but they said it was their little brother; he was crying hysterically. two little fucking cunts who should've been aborted is what i think. james bulger (the baby) deserved to live."
12483,"i know, that is what scares me; he is completely untraceable. 

i know what he looks like because there's a mugshot of him when he was a kid"
