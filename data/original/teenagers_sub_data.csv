# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",/r/teenagers,Stop saying “shut up boomers”,Meemes_4life

I personally think it's equally comfortable to hold as the Libra, but I've read online that some people dislike the bump. It is a little less comfortable trying to read one-handed in bed. If it makes any difference, I have pretty large hands. If you're reading in a cool environment without a case, the aluminum back feels cold to the touch. The Oasis is surprisingly thin in the area opposite the battery bump, so I think you would need a case to protect it if you plan to travel with it. Nevertheless it does feel sturdy to me. 

I don't know what it is about the Oasis, but I think the text feels more readable, as if it's slightly bolder or blacker. And now that I've read more with it, the converted formatting is even better than it was in the original epub– I suspect it's due to the fact that Calibre lets you select that you're reading specifically on a Kindle Oasis. If you'd like to see the conversion process, this video was super informative:

I haven't sent any articles to it and I likely won't be frequently using that feature, but I also found this that might be helpful to you: https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle

Using Calibre, it was really easy to convert all my ebooks and transfer them to the Kindle. There was no issue in the formatting or spacing of the text when going from EPUB to AZW3.  Using Overdrive to send a borrowed library ebook to the Oasis wasn't an issue either since I live in the USA. Page turns are also noticeably faster on the Kindle due to the faster processor, although I do think it has worse (but still good) battery life than the Libra.

6784,"Shaman has tons of mixup potential. For example, you can soft feint her chain finisher heavies into dodges, this means you can soft feint the  unblockable into a pounce if the opponent is bleeding for example. You can soft feint finisher heavies into GB's too, even hard feint into a zone attack or heavies which can be soft feinted again. 

Just from her zone attack you can go through with it, soft feint into bleed, hard feint, hard feint into double light, hard feint into heavy soft feint bleed. hard feint to GB. And those are just some examples. I can't reiterate enough that you need to mix her attacks up. Go into practice and practise a bunch of mixups.

Oh, and her dodge attacks count as chain starters so you can do a dodge forward attack into heavy soft feinted into a dodge forward heavy, creating an infinite chain of sorts.

Oh, and here's the max punishes

Heavy Parry: First half of a zone attack or double lights. (You can also go for a bite, but it isn't guaranteed so feint it and do it again. Most people will automatically dodge the first)

Light parry, Bite or Heavy.

GB: Heavy from any side.

OOS Parry, side dodge heavy into unblockable (or when bleeding side dodge heavy into unblockable soft feint dodge into pounce.)

OOS throw, forward dodge heavy into unblockable

Her Bash guarantees the first half of a zone, double light, or a heavy if it wallsplats.

If you're OOS and you GB, you get a light, same on light parry. If you wallsplat I think you get a heavy but it depends on distance.

Similar to many other sexual activities, CBT can be performed using toys and devices to make the penis and testicles more easily accessible for attack, or for foreplay purposes.[3][4]

Ball stretcher

￼

A metal ball stretcher and cock ring, which forces penis' erection.

A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is used to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. This can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up. Intended to make one's testicles permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the male genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if over-tightened.

While leather stretchers are most common, other models consist of an assortment of steel rings that fastens with screws, causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer's testicles. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches.[5] A more dangerous type of ball stretcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one's scrotum until it is eventually stretched to the desired length.

Ball crusher

A ball crusher is a device made from either metal or often clear acrylic that squeezes the testicles slowly by turning a nut or screw. How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. A ball crusher is often combined with bondage, either with a partner or by oneself.

Parachute

A parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. It is conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached.

Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. Moderate weights of 3–5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage, though occasionally much heavier weights are used. Smaller weights can be used when the male wearing it is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.[citation needed]

Humbler

￼

Man with humbler

A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene.

The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing anything from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Testicle cuffs

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.

Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.[citation needed]

However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view.

Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes.

Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse.

Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm.

Cock harness

A cock harness is a penile sex toy designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with BDSM activities. The Gates of Hell is a male chastity device made up of multiple cock rings that can be used for CBT.[6] Kali's Teeth is a metal bracelet with interior spikes that closes around the penis and can be used for preventing or punishing erections.[7]

Ball busting

￼

""Ball busting"" is the practice of kicking or kneeing men in the testicles. It carries several medical risks, including the danger of testicular rupture from blunt trauma.

CBT in Japan

Tamakeri (玉蹴り) (lit. ball kicking) is a sexual fetish and subgenre of BDSM within which a man's testicles are abused. The genre is also referred to as ballbusting (""bb"" for short).[8][9] Tamakeri is the Japanese term, but it is used by many non-Japanese people to describe media where Asian people—mainly women—are participating in it. The dynamics of tamakeri consist of a masochist having their testicles hurt by a sadist.[10] The fetish is popular among heterosexual and homosexual men and women.[11] In hentai communities, it is often identified by either ""tamakeri"", or ""crotch_kick"".[12][13]

Denkianma (電気按摩) (lit. ""electric massage"") is a popular Japanese prank played between two people where one person puts their foot into the genital area of the other and shakes it in a vibrating motion.[14][15] Often this is done by grabbing the other person's feet, raising them, and then placing one's own foot on their crotch and vibrating it. This is often done between school aged boys as a prank similar to kancho and could be seen by a western audience as a type of bullying. In 2007 the crisps company Doritos released a new flavour of potato chip called ""Denkianma"".[16]

Safety

This section needs attention from an expert in Health. The specific problem is: concerns medical topics, but lacks appropriate citations.

Loss of blood flow is one of the biggest risks in cock and ball torture (CBT), which can be seen with loss of color and edemas.[17] Bondage in which the testicles are tied to something else is especially dangerous, increasing the risk of the testicles getting damaged through excessive tension or pulling.

The most serious injuries are testicular rupture, testicular torsion and testicular avulsion, which are medical emergencies that require urgent medical attention.[18]

Urethral fingering is an example of CBT which needs special precautions, such as not having a sharp nail on the finger inserted inside penis. Image shows a woman doing urethral fingering.

So if you were to eat human flesh, would it taste good or bad? Just hear me out! Taking to really think about what you’re eating is connected to whether or not you’re living a happy life. That’s why I think it’s really important. So there are animals that are carnivores, right? You know, like lions, cats, and vultures. You won’t find meat from carnivores like at a restaurant. Why is that? Because it’s too smelly to eat! It’s disgusting! Listen up, guys! Cats are too disgusting to eat. Are we on the same page so far? I’d never eat a cat, even if some culinary expert said it was the best thing ever! On the other hand, have you heard of a fish called “sweetfish”? Sweetfish don’t eat bugs. They only eat algae. They’re vegetarian. Usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat, but sweetfish guts are delicious. It’s because they’re not carnivores. So with that logic in mind, all the meat we consider delicious is from a herbivorous animals! Cows, pigs, and chickens! The better their feed, the better they taste! Which leads us to this conclusion... Humans would taste gross because they eat meat!",/r/teenagers,"The most delicious animals (cows, pigs, chicken) don’t eat meat, so vegans must be more delicious to cannibals.",summonerofsalt

7604,"Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.",/r/teenagers,Funny Valentine belongs here,summonerofsalt

I've lived with her my whole life and I believed everything she said for a long time. Until I grew enough self respect to stop relying on her.,/r/teenagers,Is it normal?,DeadBreadSliced

8923,"Finasteride can be safe if you're ready for the challenge. Is your mind ready? Are you mentally prepared? Don't look on Propecia Help, that shit is a wormhole. Just a rule of thumb, if you want to start Finasteride you gotta get a hormanal test which includes Estrogen, DHT, Testesterone, Free-Test, Androgen receptors (if possible). These are what Fin affects crucially. 

Persistent side effects or Post-Finasteride Syndrome occurs when there's an alteration going with your body as it's trying to get back to normal. People say it can cause potential damage to your androgen receptors (rushing DHT), or the rebound effect doesn't go as planned. None of these has been proven though.

If you take it, keep caution, and have your doctor monitor you.",/r/teenagers,Is finasteride safe?,CuteCandyCane

Also, I get 19 and 20 are literally right next to each other but if you do dumb things at 19 your forgiven because your still a teen but at 20 you'll be looked down upon..not sure if that's true or not. Also its ok to be immature at 20, its not like ur 30 lol.

8997,goodluck :),/r/teenagers,I’m over her [F15],CuteCandyCane
8998,"I'll just post it here since I'm over it.

I have social anxiety/used to have obsessive thoughts/depression

It all started with my looks: no girls would talk to me because i believed i was just ugly af. Because of this i devoloped body dysmorphia which is a mental health disorder where your afraid of your own shadow. You constantly avoid mirrors/cameras because you believe your repulsive. So i forgot what i looked like for two years. At 19 it just became worse and worse. I started to have crushes which the first one failed. I overthank constantly on the what ""ifs"". My post history says a lot. I had hairloss too which fucked with my mind because there's a drug that treats with hairloss called Finasteride but this drug has the ability to make you infertile/cause sexual side effects/cause man boobs. These side effects sometimes persists. That's a condition called post-finasteride syndrome. This literally destroyed me. People called me a hyperchondriac, because i was too obsessed with the side effects even though they happen rarely. I had to make a choice, hair or my sex life. This ultimatly led me to attempt suicide. I was already failing university and i had a major crush on a girl in which she rejected me. So i had nothing to live for. I was in the hospital and eventually released. It was really bad. I started to watch high school shooting videos to make myself feel better. I was really abusive and edgy. Everything is going downhill. It wasn't pretty. Doctors thought i was going crazy because they kept on telling me i was overthinking. At the time i was dealing with vision problems and prostate pain. It was all caused by stress (no surprise aye?). After all of this i posted something really dark on social media, and the police came and brought me to the hospital. I was there for three days and i saw a prisoner and he was so fucking scary. I realized at that point my life could be better than this. I can be out there enjoying my life. Fuck girls. I can't be stuck here. I'm so glad i wasn't too late to fix this. Imagine i was there for a year or something. This made me chuckle, i remember asking the police if i could listen to music in the car. They said yes. After i was discharged i was a free man. I lost my bestfriend but i didnt let that stop me. I had to get my shit together. So i did. Honestly i didnt get any therapy. I focused on my mental health and physical health. My brain now doesn't recognize depression or suicidal thoughts. I no longer watch high school shooting videos. I don't do any of that stupid shit. I was a dumb naieve, 19 year old who was clearly struggling and had no alternatives. Or so i thought. My friends reassured me looks arent everything and life is more meaningful than just looks.

Now to this day, my social life is great. I have tons of friends, I'm posting more pictues of my face which is something i havent done in 3 years. I'm so much better physically and mentally. Hell i got my libido back! (sex drive). I get shit tons of requests from girls now. Everything is going amazing. I don't believe this was a phase i was going through. But i just needed help but i was too scared to get help. With the addition of that, I overcame my social anxiety and i just live up to my life with my great personality. I'm getting jaw surgery next year to fix my breathing issues. I just need patience.",/r/teenagers,"I'm writing a book on a character with multiple mental sicknesses, and I need help.",CuteCandyCane

9057,yeah ill give it a shot. Currently im on a Justin Bieber/Selena/Kesha phase but ill make sure to listen to that XD,/r/teenagers,"To the Justin Bieber fangirls of 2009-2014, do you wish that Justin married Selena Gomez?",CuteCandyCane
9058,no way. They are a perfect match. Justin was just young and reckless because of all that fame and money. If he had the maturity to control his finances then i gaurantee he'd be married to Selena and didn't abuse his relationships due to drug abuse. He knew selena since he was 14?? and dated all the way to 21? That's a prolong and significant dating gap.,/r/teenagers,"To the Justin Bieber fangirls of 2009-2014, do you wish that Justin married Selena Gomez?",CuteCandyCane

But to also say, our convo that we had for five days straight it was all in caps for example ""LMAOO YOUR A DUMBASS"" and I said ""YOUR A COWWW"" and she said ""WELL UR A DONKEY"" so I guess we have chemistry 

But I left her on read after she sent me two laughing emojis after she asked me ""HOWS BEING GROUNDED BITCH"" and yeah haven't heard from her since and it's been two days. 
Also don't judge our texting style haha

9129,Ohh yeah everything you said is true sometimes it is hard to maintain streaks since I killed some of them due to forgetting or I wasn't on a lot. The only thing I like about snap than insta or others is that it feels your more secure and safe with private stories and it's so easy to record whatever is happening with a click of a button and post. Streaks is just the fun of snap and it's like a game for me. Filters is just something I'm experimenting and it's funny haha. Bitemoji are also cool and a girl is more likely to say yes to ask for her Snapchat than number or something. That's just my view and experience.

Minoxidil: doesn't work all the time, but it can help regrow some hair and thicken since it expands the blood vessels allowing oxygen and nutrients to reach the hair follicles thus altering hair growth.

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, •	⁠Spreading incorrect information, •	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",/r/teenagers,rap madness final 4 results,Diambil

11616,"I thought there was plenty of psychology and storytelling. They all had a different story. 

Rollins had the problem of no J and J security because they were quickly eliminated from the equation, so his body language throughout the match indicated desperateness and almost adrenaline caused out of fear of Brock, whom is his biggest problem then. Cena was the upstanding babyface, who doesn't back down from a challenge; however, his one problem was Lesnar. Lesnar was a big, scary and unstoppable monster. He absolutely destroyed Cena at Summerslam, and at COC kicked out of the last Attitude Adjustment but the match was stopped by Rollins. Basically, the whole dynamic throughout the first half was, ""Rollins and Cena have to take down Lesnar.""


 The second half was a continuation of Cena and Rollins' rivalry. The story was that these two were equals, and Rollins without J and J once again forced him to actually use his talents to win. Rollins got desperate yet again, so he pulled out the phoenix splash, and just when he was about to win, Lesnar recovered and won.

George is my favourite cat. He's a British Shorthair with Clouded Leopard colours, with a big white patch on the bellyand having stripes for patterns.

Ruby is the female cat, aunt to George. Snow leopard colours, with a big white patch on the bottom and the top being snow leopard prints. Very soft and thin face.

Archie is Ruby's son, exact same colour as her, but bigger face.

Jasmine is Ruby's daughter, almost entirely black, striking resemblance to that of a Black Panther. Body and face composition almost entirely like Ruby's.

Rosy is George's sister, with the same colours and body as Ruby, but with a mean look on her face. It looks like she is frowning most of the time.


Josh is Rosy's brother, and George's brother. He has the colours of a normal Leopard, he's a big cat, not fat, but big. The same frowning face as Rosy.

Coco is a cat that appeared on our gate one day, and we kept her ever since. She's very, very skinny, and has a rather circular face. 


Lily is Rosy's daughter, and I'm pretty sure, Josh's daughter (sweet home Alabama). She has the colours of a clouded leopard and the same frowning face.


Jess is my dog, and a lovely one at that.

11939,"Read my edit, I realized my mistake. I didn't compare them, and only looked at them separately. Still, there can be arguments against this;

Finn has had mainstream exposure before: he was the first universal champion, was featured on Wrestlemania, involved in championship programs on the main roster, et cetera, while Dream was in NXT for 2 years before it wasn't developmental anymore. It's not an example of being a star, it's more so Finn being more exposed to main stream audiences.

Secondly, are search results really examples of stardom? An example of stardom would be to get a group of people and see who most appeals to them. Coincidentally enough, there was one. A few months ago,  there was a survey done by Bleacher report, I believe that they showed non-wwe fans WWE wrestlers and they got their average score of certain wrestlers, and it was made into a top 5 list. Finn Balor was no where near that list. Dream? He was either 2, 3, or 4. 


My second paragraph isn't anecdotal though; it's just pure fact. Dream gets the louder reactions, louder pops, et cetera. If you compare the decibal levels between Dreams match with Tommaso Ciampa at Wargames 2, and then go on to the next year where Finn had his first match back in NXT, you'll find that Dream is simply more over. Hell, if you compare the twos first match at Wargames, Dream, who is debuting, is more over than Balor.

Again, none of Superman's self deprecating qualities are shown in Doomsday Clock. Obviously, there would be well written comics saying as such, but it's never expanded upon. 

He didn't kill millions of people to be in control of the world; his plan was for all the uniting governments to align and take control themselves. He never wanted to be in control of the world. 

He killed and sabotaged people he knew, yes; but not for no reason. He absolutely needed no one who knew about his plan to come out alive, otherwise he would risk exposure of his plan, which would send the world back into chaos. 


Superman isn't a good role model; he sets unattainable standards for morality and ethicality.

12037,"The characters in Watchmen aren't supposed to be heroes; they're supposed to people with flaws, positives and weaknesses. Rorshach is a terrible person, (at least before the prison break) but he's not a terrible person because of an experiment gone wrong; not because he got gross with power; he became a terrible person because of bad circumstances. He's realistic, he's human, and that's why people love him. Not because they think he is a hero, but because he's human. 

All the characters in Watchmen didn't give up; they all agreed that Ozy's plan was for the best, and that they should keep quiet. The exact opposite of selfish; they thought about what was best for mankind, and they went through with it. You could argue Rorshach was selfish in his goals, but I see it as him thinking what was the best for mankind.  

Ozymandias is the closest thing to a hero in the book. He saved mankind from inevitable doom, while having to live with the guilt of his actions. Again, exact opposite of selfish. 



This is why I think Superman is a poorly written character, or at the very least, couldn't work in the Watchmen universe. I get the point of him, but it simply doesn't work. Superman doesn't overcome anything, he simply gets over it by being ""the best of us."" It completely destroys what Watchmen did, and it's legacy.

Let me call out two specific moments from each book. Then you'll see my point.


Dan overhears a man talking about Hollis, and investigates. He learns through this man that Hollis was murdered. Hollis, someone who isn't even related to Dan, and a person Dan only sees on Saturdays, was murdered.

Dan nearly beats the man who told him this to death, a man who he doesn't even know is responsible for it, a man who only gave him information on it. Rorshach had to step in to stop him. Dan had a mental breakdown, just like any normal person would, any person could relate to. Watchmen set a precedent for books and comics, it set a legacy. Now, we don't have the corny and cheesy lines from regular comic books with characters that nobody can relate to, a character that has almost no human qualities to him. The entire point of Watchmen was that not everything is black and white, you can't solve things with a superman because... Realistically? A Superman wouldn't exist. No higher being has the foresight of Superman, the moral grandstand that Superman has, the kindness, et cetera. This universe makes this message clear, and that was what made Watchmen unique. That's what made it excellent. 


Situation 2. Doomsday Clock. 

Superman learns that this blue entity has been responsible for all the bad shit in his life, all the suffering, all the death, everything. He sees someone coming behind this blue entity, and it appears to be targeting it. Superman saves this blue entity, and immediately puts aside what he told him.

This is why Doomsday Clock ruined Watchmen. These universes were NEVER supposed to connect. The point of Watchmen was to make the characters human, make things not so black and white... But now, it isn't that. Geoff Johns now irreparably damaged Watchmen forever with his abhorrent writing and lack of understanding. Now? It's... ""You either have a superman... Or you don't.""",/r/teenagers,I hated Doomsday Clock,YEPx9
12038,"That's the problem.


Superman can't fit into the Watchmen storyline and comics because he is so ridiculously idealistic and morally correct that it ruins the nuance of the graphic novel; what message can I attain from Superman being perfect? What is there to be learned? Is there any interesting development for him?

Rorshach's stubbornness is the reason he died. It's the reason why he didn't quickly figure out who killed the Comedian. 

Moral philosophy DEFINES a person's ideological and philosophical beliefs, which is a defining trait of every human being on this planet. 

His social awkwardness and lack of awareness around people are defining traits; his lack of self awareness is apparent during his visit with Manhattan and Laurie, describing Laurie's mothers rape as a ""moral lapse"", which then gets Manhattan to teleport him out of the facility quickly, leaving him none the wiser.

Again, illiteracy is a defining trait in someone, and speaks volumes of their mental state. He was quite literate before discovering the dead 6 year old.

His hatred of prostitution comes from a deeply rooted hatred of his mother, which is important to know.

12060,"Rorshach had plenty more to him than being a rip-off however; he had unique traits, goals, backstory, et cetera. There's a difference a rip off and a character which is inspired by another character.

- He is unhygienic. 

- he empathises with children the most out of anyone.

- he is illiterate.

- very, very stubborn. 

- His philosophy is deeply rooted in objectivism and existentialism. 

- he hates prostitutes. 

- he is uncompromising, and so much so, it's to his own detriment: he sees everything as black and white, and there's no in-between. 

- he has no social awareness.

- he's unaware to what comforts people.

- He learns to empathise with people later on in the story.

Also, his character arc is different; after breaking out of the prison, he's still his old self; rude, unapologetic, and quite frankly, he was still a twat. Even to his former best friend, Dan. He constantly berates Dan for sneaking underwater and hiding, and Dan snaps. He apologizes right afterward, but Rorshach ignores it and apologizes to dan; telling Dan that he is a good friend, and that sometimes, it is difficult. Dan gets this, and Rorshach holds his hand out for a hand shake, and Dan obliges. It's implied that Rorshach held this handshake for too long, which adds to my point of him lacking social awareness. Later on,  Dan learned thaat Hollis Mason was murdered, so in turn, Rorshach tries to comfort Dan by saying the mask killer theory is likely because of this. Dan is pissed at first, and Rorshach explains that it was meant to comfort him, because it would mean that if the theory was true, Dan could get his vengeance upon the killer. Of course, Dan nearly asks how this is supposed to comfort him, but realizes Rorshach was trying to be kind, and accepts it.",/r/teenagers,I hate Doomsday Clock,YEPx9

I'm saying this as I re-watched the match recently, and I thought originally that it was, like you said, a spot-fest but it truly wasn't; there was like one sequence where psychology wasn't involved and it was the classic back and forth forearm strikes and moves all over the place spot. 

You must be mistaking it for the Toronto match, the New York match won the award. That Toronto match was completely and utterly devoid of psychology.

Jesus Christ.... Drew McIntyre absolutely failed in his first run, and he was supposed to be the chosen one; he failed, and he was released. His dream had been crushed, every thing fell down around him... The only thing left to do was get back up. And he did. He came back better than ever, more than determined than ever, and his dream? Win the world title and main event Wrestlemania. The only person standing in the way?

 Brock. Lesnar. Lesnar has crushed the hopes and dreams of nearly everyone. Kofi, Ricochet, Rollins, Reigns, Goldberg, Undertaker, so many people. He only lives for himself and will crush anyone standing in his way. He has no consideration towards feelings, he doesn't play mind games, he never compromises. He has effortlessly destroyed Cena, Kofi, Ricochet, Rollins, et cetera. This is why he is the best obstacle for Drew; this is Drew's dream, what he worked for his entire life, but Lesnar doesn't care in the slightest. He doesn't know what Drew went through because he never experienced what Drew went through, he never had to work that hard to get to the main event, it was never a life long grind. He is the perfect anti-thesis to Drew.

In terms of actual personality? They're both confrontational and fearless, regardless of alignment. It could make for some intimidating segments. They're also both fairly goofy and self aware at times.",/r/teenagers,A look at the ''Storylines'' 5 weeks away from Wrestlemania.,YEPx9

The Randy storyline works best with Randy because nobody has a history of injuring and nearly killing people like him. Edge's history with the neck and eliminating Orton from the rumble also plays into the storyline.

Wrestler 1 had a problem with wrestler 2. Wrestler 1 and wrestler 2 have a match. Wrestler 2 gets mad wrestler 1 screwed him over. Wrestler 2 gets less popular while wrestler 1 gets more popular. Wrestler 2 gets mad about this. Turns into a bad guy.

Humberto has a problem with Andrade because when they have fought, Andrade has fucked him over in nearly every single way imaginable, and as such, he fucking kayfabe injured him out of anger.

Being the Elite is a web series to a 2 hour long TV show. I shouldn't have to waste my time watching 50 10 - 20 minute long episodes to even understand what is going on within the other two hour show. It's way too much time and effort.",/r/teenagers,A Comprehensive Guide to the Hangman Page/Kenny Omega/Young Bucks Drama from Being The Elite and Dynamite Leading Into AEW Revolution,YEPx9

With all the episodes of Dynamite, I seriously doubt they couldn't have fit a backstage segment where Hangman apologizes lmao. You act like these have to be 20 minutes, but all they have to fucking be is 3-5 minutes of the Elite talking backstage every once in a while.


No, it's not like a Marvel movie; Marvel movies are like episodes of a TV show, very long episodes where every one is as important as the other. I'll give you an example, imagine if the only scenes Thanos appeared in were the scenes where he collected the infinity stones, and he's given little to no characterisation. Also, remove all semblance of his relationship with Nebula form previous movies, and all of the scenes he has with her is confusing because there's clearly tension between them but it's never explained: and then Marvel reveals in order to actually learn about Thanos' character and why we should care about him, we have to read a 100 part comic series explaining everything about him bit by bit, and giving him development that is integral, why he wants to eliminate half of the universe, et cetera, in order to understand the movie and his relationship with Gamora. It'd be fucking annoying and inconvenient, and a sign of laziness on terms of storytelling, which is why Marvel didn't do that. But the Elite aren't very self aware, so they still do it, completely ignorant to most people's thoughts, which is, ""I don't care about this low budget TV show called BTE, I just want to watch Dynamite.""

Again, if you don't watch Being The Elite, you'll be asking yourself, ""Why are they not getting along?""

Velveteen Dream is DEFINITELY the type of character to do that shit. He is, by nature, a dick, that people like. He damn near cheated to win his match with Breeze, and he stole a win of Roddy in Toronto, now this. The things UE did that you presented would also be fair game with Dream

Dream also clearly ain't trying to commit adultery, he's just fucking with Roddy. That's Dream's MO, he fucks with rivals through mind games.

This mirrors the approach of other survivor subreddits. Also, the Reddit policy's intent is to restrict content that ""depicts, encourages or promotes"" the sexualization of underage persons, and the purpose of this subreddit is the exact opposite of that. However, be aware that posts and replies in violation may still be subject to removal and Reddit-wide suspension of the author by the Reddit admins. So please use common sense when posting/replying. We want this to remain a safe space for survivors to share, heal and thrive, but we need to be mindful of the site-wide rules regarding these sensitive topics.

  * Allowed: When I post a photo using android, I get error message 420 and it doesn't go through
* Not allowed: All posts missing
  * Allowed: Since three weeks ago, every post I make on my profile page ends up disappearing, and no one, including me, can see it
* Not allowed: I've had my account disabled
  * Allowed: I've recently had my account disabled.  I reached out to Facebook and have heard nothing, and I've been posting the same tihngs for years.

I don’t mean to sound crazy or controlling. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for four years, and having been dating long distance for a year. I plan to move there in May. 

There’s been a behavioural pattern that I’ve noticed. I’ve never said anything because I don’t want to be overbearing, but it’s really starting to make me angry. 

Whenever anyone else phones him, he hangs up. Most of the time without a goodbye and he just says something like “one sec”. He lives in his dads home until he moves into our new house, I don’t see why someone that he sees everyday is taking precedence over me. I get there’s emergencies and all that, but it’s literally every single time that man calls, I am just tossed aside. Same with his brother, who is also in the same city. When his mother calls, I kind of understand as she and I live in the same city and he doesn’t talk to her too often. 

He also never answers the phone when he’s with someone else. There’s been times where I’ve needed to talk about something time sensitive, texted him prior to calling to let him know, and he will just decline.  When I’m with my friends and their boyfriend calls, they answer without a second thought. They don’t have a long conversation, but they always answer. So do I. Is it rude I expect the same?

I just find it really rude and irritating. When I’m on the phone with him, I’m not going to hang up on him if someone else that I’m about to see calls. If I do have to go, I literally always tell him who’s calling, and that I love him and I’ll call back. 

AITA for expecting the same courtesy?

So let's get right into it. I'd say about 2.5 months ago I got together with my GF. This is my very first relationship so I, of course, do not have much experience. I believe that our relationship has been going very well and we are at a pretty close stage already. She took me out of a pretty dark place and for that, I am extremely grateful to her. I care for and love her a lot and there is nothing more I want than for her to be safe and happy.

Let's call my GF b. One day b decides to go make some friends online. She finds a ""friend"" who we will call K. She chats with him for a few days and one day casually mentions to me ""if I wasn't dating you then I'd probably date K"" which of course hurt. She sees this, says sorry and reassures me that she wouldn't leave me. Her saying these things is normal for her as she has autism so she can't determine whether that would hurt me or not as well as other people could. She has also said this about multiple other people which makes me worry. Anyway, K wants to play a game with her in the morning and b says yes. I am fine with this as it's not like anything bad could happen, right? Everything is fine at this point. Then, in the morning, b finds out that K doesn't want to play any games. In fact, he attempts to sext her, already knowing that she has a boyfriend. She lets him know once again that she has a boyfriend and then he begins to say quite a few ""unacceptable things"" for my standards. ""can't he just, not know?"", ""I only friended you cause you looked cute and I wanted to get together with you"", ""I hate your boyfriend"", ""are you thinking of breaking up with him"" and so on. This isn't including many other things she might not have told me. (She hides things from me sometimes). I get a bit angrier than I'd like to admit but I stay calm talking to her. He starts to ghost her and her mood lessens cause she has already had bad experiences with ghosting before and she feels like she lost a ""friend"". I tell her ""do you really wanna be friends with somebody who is only friends with you because of sexual intentions?"". She agreed with me and that was that. Until today. B gets a message from K again. ""sorry about last night I was just a bit horny"". Tf kind of excuse is that??. Anyway, he mentions he wants to play a game again later foreal and she agrees! Apparently from then on, nothing had ever happened. I didn't wanna be that boyfriend and tell her who she can and can't talk to so I didn't really say much. She is also being a bit distant of recent. I can be very paranoid and right now I'm just feeling pretty hurt and worried. What could they be saying behind my back? Is he trying to manipulate her? (people have manipulated her in the past) I love her more than anything but I don't know. After all the stuff he and she said AITA for being paranoid and worried?

TLDR: Some guy tries to sext my GF and says some pretty unacceptable things to her. Once rejected he pretends as nothing happened and wants to do more stuff with her.

13022,"Hello, and welcome to /r/yiffinhell! This is a standard message stickied to the top of every post, here to remind people of some of the more commonly broken rules:

- Rule 1: Furries posting/commenting here: You will be banned, this is to keep furries from overrunning the subreddit and causing trouble, and to prevent a bunch of ""not all furries are like that"" comments on every post.

- Rule 2: No bigotry. Racism, homophobia, transphobia or anything of that nature will not be tolerated here.

- Rule 7: Please do not make comments encouraging/threatening/condoning violence or physical harm at the individuals posted here, even as a joke. Encouraging violence is against this subreddit's rules AND Reddit's site-wide rules, and you will be banned if you are found breaking this rule.

Please make sure you read the rules and posting guidelines, which can be found in the sidebar on both [old](https://old.reddit.com/r/yiffinhell/) and [new](https://new.reddit.com/r/yiffinhell/) reddit, prior to participating.

13048,"Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Unfortunately, [your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/fs7y6m/does_the_video_world_economic_forum_facebook_page/) has been removed due to a title vviolation.  The title *must* be informative enough that anyone reading the title knows what is without opening your text post.  Please resubmit your post with a proper DESCRIPTIVE title.  The following are examples of titles we do not allow (even if they are long enough), and will be removed (constantly submitting bad titles can get you banned):

* Not allowed: Begging... seriously, stop it.  You don't need ???? or please help, the fact you are posting notes you want help.
* Not allowed: Not sure if this is the place to post, but this happens when trying to post a photo using and android. Thanks for any help
  * Allowed: When I post a photo using android, I get error message 420 and it doesn't go through
* Not allowed: All posts missing
  * Allowed: Since three weeks ago, every post I make on my profile page ends up disappearing, and no one, including me, can see it
* Not allowed: I've had my account disabled
  * Allowed: I've recently had my account disabled.  I reached out to Facebook and have heard nothing, and I've been posting the same tihngs for years.
* Not allowed: Issues with Facebook app (or) I can't post anything with the Facebook app
  * Allowed: I've been having issues with the Facebook app where I cannot post anything.  When I do, the send button greys out as if I touched it, but nothing shows up on my feed.
  
  Do not send a message to modmail noting, ""Well it's as descriptive as it can be.""

- Vlogs or other ""Day In the Life"" content from people who happen to be powerlifters.

- Standard training days of even elite powerlifters.  Competition style lifts with low-rep PRs (1, 2, 3 reps) are generally acceptable, someone's every gym session is not.

- Multiple posts of the same content.  If submits the same link before you, their post will be appoved and yours left here in the automod ether.  [We can mourn together for the loss of your karma.](https://media.giphy.com/media/PVEi5DD7k7Nwk/giphy.gif)

13092,"Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

Now I live in a dumpster outside a McDonald’s with free WiFi. At night I sneak into the McDonald’s like my new raccoon dad, Stripey, taught me to do so I can charge my phone. Through the cracked screen I am still perpetually amazed by the graphics of this game... they look so real! Thank you Obama, you truly changed my life!

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -> *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Title: >![Buying][W] 44mm Silver Link Bracelet [H] PayPal, Local cash!<

Body: Local is downtown La. looking for APPLE OEM only. Looking to spend 100-150$.

As a precaution and reminder, Paypal Goods and Services is the only option that gives you *any* chance at fighting scammers. While it will not 100% guarantee anything, other forms of payments such as Zelle/Venmo/Friends&Family/Apple Pay/Crypto/Etc do not offer any type of protection. This is not to say that you should not accept other forms of payment, but exercise caution especially to those with newer accounts/low combined karma counts.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -> *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

I liked this guy (Tyler) for 2 years, since my first day at high school. We go to an institute where the classes last all day (7:30 am - 5:30 pm) and we have the same classmates until the last year. I made friends there, one of them is a girl (Mary). In my 1st year, we had a party where I drank too much and was feeling TERRIBLE when Tyler sat by my side and started talking about the fact I was into him. I confessed and in my undeniable drunk state, I told him I knew he was into Mary and that he'd like me if I was a pretty girl like her. The problem in this situation is that he RECORDED me saying all this shit. I kinda realized what was happening and started to cry, so my friends made him delete all the audios. He left and I need to say that Mary didn't like him back and she was PISSED with him so she ended up punching Tyler in front of everyone. 

He apologized several times and we got closer to each other, becoming ""friends"". For the next 2 years, he broke my heart repeatedly, made me cry on my own bday, kissing me and never telling me if he was indeed feeling the same for me. I was an idiot, but I really liked him 'cause he was so intelligent and talented. And Mary, as my best friend, saw everything he did to me.

Recently Mary told me she was into a guy, but she couldn't tell me who. I understood immediately. I was trying to get over Tyler, I rly was, but I liked him for 2 years and it was hard for me. The classes started again and they were rly close to each other. I was extremely hurt so I decided to talk to her, but I was dumb again. I told her I knew what was happening and asked her for her sincerity about everything - but I CLEARLY asked her for patience. I needed her to wait for a while 'cause I was getting over everything and needed time to process. It was on a Friday. On Tuesday we went to a party (no classes that day) and Mary and Tyler hooked up in the same place I was, but they hid from me. I was having a good time with friends and Tyler and Mary disappeared, but I thought she wouldn't do that to me. The next day, on Wednesday, we had classes and they spent ALL DAY together. I thought I could deal with everything, but I ended up crying in an empty classroom. That night, Mary sent me a text telling she hooked up with Tyler and she was ""hoping I didn't mind"". But I told her I do 'cause my bf was with the boy I liked for 2 years, who hurted me for 2 YEARS straight and she saw everything, but still think he worth it. She called me an asshole and told me she couldn't throw away her feelings because of me. I cried my soul off that day and ended up feeling rly guilty for bothering her and Tyler, but I feel so bad with all this situation because a stupid boy is making me lose my best friend. Plus, they're still seeing each other but once again, hiding from me, while Mary tries to keep me close even knowing (well, I guess she knows) it's hurting me. AITA?

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -> *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines in the ""Rules"" section of the sidebar.

This is the proper way to format a title -> *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, W, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.
