19,"There used to be a little storage center hidden back by the railroad tracks catty corner to the soccer field where the old water tower is (was). I haven't been there in ages. I think that all of that is torn down now. But it's too bad because for decades it was a kind of hidden USC landmark - the place where all the shitty bands had practice, and therefore a great place for casual parties to spontaneously happen (in non-pandemic situations of course). The code to get in was 1234 and everyone knew that.  

I'm almost certain it's gone now but that's still a good way to do it if you can scrounge up the money to pay for a unit. Not sure how great the accoustics are in a space that small but most storage places are used to college aged bands practicing there during the day or early evening and don't care. Go with a independent place rather than one of the big chain places as they are always a lot looser with the rules.

68,"College students obviously don't tip well but they do give you bong hits. There was a house with a hot tub where some gay guys lived and they were in the hot tub most nights when they ordered food. Often naked. They tipped really well. Always invited us in. I never took them up, though one of my co-workers did. Gay guys in general were some of the best customers - always very fun, having parties and stuff, always really friendly and tipped well. 

I did have women come to the door in lingerie and invite me in, but they were never the women you'd want to be doing that, lol. 

There are people like what I think these strip club delivery customers are like - folks with a lot of money they could just drop on anything and like being catered to. So for example this one guy was a big construction contractor on a job for the university we were near. The first time he ordered he introduced himself and called a couple more times that night. He had a woman over and would order one small item from the menu to get delivered and ask to talk to me personally, and request that I pick him up a case of beer or some smokes or whatever and bring those too - and he'd give me a $20 tip in addition to paying me back. So me and a couple other drivers got on pretty good terms with that guy and he'd call almost every night with these ""extras"" but we loved it because he was so generous (and a pretty fun/laid back dude). Turns out the woman was just his in town mistress while he was on the job, his wife was back home. It became a real issue when they finished the construction job and he went back home. The mistress started stalking him and showing up at his house and threatening the wife, etc. and a couple of us got subpoenas from the mistress to go testify in a court case about it because we'd witnessed them staying together at the apartment he was living in while on the job (the place we delivered to). She lost, it was actually a pretty stupid case, I don't even recall what the actual lawsuit was about. She was basically just angry that he broke up with her and had been using her just as his temp side piece while on the job and wanted to hurt him legally, I think. 

Wasn't all fun and games, though. One of the other drivers was mugged. He was walking up to a house and a man came up behind him with a garrote and wrapped it around his neck and threatened to cut his head off if he didn't get the money. He got the money. Driver drove back to the shop and quit on the spot. I got into a couple very minor car accidents like scraping someone's bumper pulling out of a tight parking spot, and got a couple of tickets for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign or something dumb like that, but never had anything really bad happen like getting mugged. Though I was sure after that friend got mugged to never keep my tips from the night on me, and to stash them back at the store in between deliveries. 

I worked for a short while at a Papa John's in a different area, and the manager there gave all police free pizza. Which meant that the delivery drivers there always got a warning and never a ticket. I wish the first place had that set up! 

It was one of the best and most fun jobs I ever had. It is barely like working, and the money was actually fantastic. This was back in the 90's and the Clinton economy was doing great - better IMO than it's ever been since. But I'd work a shift on a typical Thursday night and make $150 in tips on top of minimum wage base pay plus a certain amount for mileage (for gas and wear and tear on the car - which really was an issue because you drive so much and it's all stop and go, hard on the car). But I was a college student and had roommates so my weekly paycheck was just enough to cover my bills like rent and utilities, meaning that all of that cash was mine to do with what I liked for the most part. I, of course, blew most of it like a dummy. 

Oh, I nearly forgot. This was in Columbia, SC, by the University, in the 90's like I said. Which brings me to a group who was some of our best tippers of all - Hootie and the Blowfish. They had just gotten famous (and rich) but still lived in a party house right by campus. I wasn't a big fan of their music but they were very cool guys and having just become multi-millioniares they definitely tipped well!

It's a really neat job, and other than the things like wearing out your car a bit it has very few downsides. I do think location and what kind of restaurant you work for makes a difference though. Being by the university meant we had a lot of fun/cool/cute customers, and that was an indie shop and they tend to have more interesting customers than some chain place like the Papa John's I worked at later.",/r/GenX,"Portland strip club forced to close, so dancers now do delivery",Loose_with_the_truth

The simple answer is “don’t bend your wrist.” Easier said than done. 

Wrap your thumb around the top of the neck if you can, that helps me play with a straight wrist. Maybe your fingers aren’t able to do this, so you can cheat a little. 

Play power chords with your index and pinky only - pinky frets then 5 and octave. Don’t play with one finger on each note. 

Play E form barre chords using the A-e strings only.

LOL.  Which libertarian ~~scholar~~ alt-right troll did you cherry-pick for that statement.  Seriously, you think because someone claims to be a libertarian it makes them a libertarian?  No, their positions make them libertarian.

That statement is as far from libertarian as I can imagine.  While yes, we're against welfare of any type (corporate or individual), we're for more open immigration policies and believe abortion is up to the individual.

1. That they already had a predilection to such beliefs

Personally, I think it's #1.  They're drawn to libertarianism for one reason.  They see libertarians standing up for freedom of speech and freedom of association so they think, ""Hey, that's us!""  Defending freedom of speech and defending the actual speech are two different things.  After some time they realize that libertarianism doesn't fit so they find a home in the alt-right.  There's no real pipeline.  One does not go from believing in individual liberty and the NAP to becoming an alt-right racist that wishes to suppress the freedom of another group.

Fishbone hit the stage and started with ""Swim"" (one of my all-time favorite songs).  The bass was so heavy that I actually started to itch all over my body.

In Chicago, there’s a statute that establishes a maximum percentage of increase on a renewing lease and it’s tied to how much the landlord invests back into the property: the landlord can’t both neglect his property and escalate the rent. 

One of the upsides of that: renters with student children don’t get priced out of their school district every other semester. 

To that, not every city has rent control standards; the result is transient residents without building a community or economic base - so all the bothers of a transient population (crime, stalled economy) are institutionalized.

My understanding is that it was for hard drugs (heroin/narcotics, meth); things that could alter cognitive abilities or motivate theft due to addiction - but that varied from site to site; sometimes pot was included, sometimes not (none of the states in concern here had legalized marijuana). 

On construction sites there was random drug testings performed by the contractor (the company that hired the union labor).  In a couple of cases, I had workers walk off the job to protect themselves when their number came up for a random drug test. The union, however, protected their job.

One case I had a worker escorted from the property for testing positive after presenting documentation (prior to taking his urine) from his union-assigned doctor for a prescription for a pain killer while recovering from a work-related injury (on different job site: fella was an iron worker that had a fall; he was assigned as a light-duty supervisor). 

I was taken to a hospital after being injured at work (threw my back out). I declined a prescription for pain killers (they make me depressed and effect my hypoglycemia).  I was screened at the time (policy: to see if the individual can be blamed for the incident) and “randomly” tested again 10d later.  When I was dismissed 3wks later, having had two drug screening tests performed within 30d made me eligible for mandatory dismissal.

Re: Bernie and Warren.  Ya, totally; they’ve done a right awful job presenting their plans.  And I doubt I can do any better.  That said, as I understand it, the money you pay out-of-pocket for insurance (be it in payroll deductions, deductibles, over-priced medications, etc) is transformed into taxes - but at an overall lesser amount than the total of your out-of-pocket-and-payroll expenses, income lost due to illness, financial ruin due to bankruptcy, etc. For those willing and able, additional coverage will still be available for private purchase. 

To me, the easiest equivalence is like a CostCo membership: I have to pay to be a member to be able to buy the goods that are sold at less than comparable retail prices; I’m spending money but I’m spending less and getting more. And I can still buy an extended warranty if I want. 

Again, that’s how I understand it. And I’m no authority on the subject. 

Re: Even-metered. These debates are such an awful format - no one looks good. When I’ve seen her even- metered is in interviews (talk shows, Sunday morning panel discussions) and the occasional CSpan footage.  

It’s so saddening that any candidate that can complete a sentence presents as a one-eyed-man, but such are the times. 

Re: a candidate promising to end insurance. I agree that no one is selling the idea well. Which is a shame; here’s my personal insight: 

My significant other works for one of the largest medical insurance companies. Her opinions influence mine as that’s how she spends 50hr/wk - she knows from the blood on her hands how broken and corrupted the insurance system is and knows reformation could eliminate her +12y career. She’s still in favor of a Medicare for all with add’l coverage option program.  

My oldest friend has juvenile-onset diabetes (Type 1). He’s been insulin dependent for ~35y.  Until Obamacare, he was either unable to get insurance or it was cost-prohibitive and/or it was entirely not insurance b/c the deductible was so high.  As it is, he’s in a dead end gig b/c it’s the best job in his field with quasi-competent coverage.  He recently had to sue to get the glucose meter his endocrinologist had been recommending for +/-3y. 

My best friend suffered with a medical condition for years without proper diagnosis b/c her coverage denied testing - for what turned out to be a treatable brain tumor, the same type and location that took her mother at the same age.   After 2y of applying for state assistance, she had surgery,.  She had to leave the workforce to be eligible. Without assistance, she would have likely orphaned her minor daughter.  Now she’s able to provide for her family and her daughter’s college. 

One of my dearests is German. She presented behavior-altering symptoms and was diagnosed with glioblastoma (brain cancer).   Her job was held for her pre- and post-surgery, her chemo and radiation treatments and even her cab fare to/from was covered by the state.  Her life expectancy is +/- 50% longer b/c of her coverage and treatment.  My uncle passed away from the same diagnosis in 3mos b/c his insurance wouldn’t cover treatments to the extent his neurologist recommended (his was a few years ago, hers was 18mos ago).

20y ago I opened up two fingers with a knife at home.  It cost me $1500 to see a doctor and get five stitches (my then job didn’t have benefits). Two months ago I suffered a similar injury.  I spent ~$40 on superglue, antibiotic ointment and bandages and DIY’d it myself. 

Yes, my taxes will change. I’m not fully financially stable but I’m willing to pony up for some security that I won’t end up homeless if I catch something beyond my control. My SO and I are childless, but I recognize the value of paying taxes to fund schools. 

(Before it comes up: my SO and I haven’t been dating long enough to consider marriage just yet - and I violently hate that medical insurance should be considered as part of deciding whether or not to make such a personal commitment. That’s some disingenuous dowry bullshit.)

These stories can’t be mine alone.  No one is content with the system as it is. There are successful models in other developed nations. Of note, Japan has the longest life expectancy, one of the strongest economies, and one of the highest standards of living. They’ve had a nationalized health care system since 1935.   Not to say they’re perfect, but that little snatch of islands are doing it better than we are. 

I refuse to believe America can’t do it and do it better. 

So, ya, I do believe that Americans can be coerced.  History has shown Americans can be sold anything if the message is loud enough. 

And this I believe: any government that doesn’t invest in its people is tyrannical.

1281,"The premise, as explained to me in Chicago 30y ago is this: if you’re too bright, you’re likely to get bored and start to learn how to trick/work the system. There is an IQ ceiling to accepted applications. Different departments and branches have different standards (municipal cops compared to staties). 

Being a cop means spending your life only seeing people at their worst and having to expect danger. Always. 

I don’t fault cops for becoming cynical. What I do have a problem with is that there’s no process to curb their cynicism before it becomes self-righteousness, like what we saw here.  

Add the paramilitary training they receive now to the cynicism and decidedly unintelligent (not meaning stupid - meaning not intelligent, as in not in the thin part on the right of the bell curve) and what we have are what we got; pawns who think they’re knights. 

So if you’re of reasonable intelligence and you think the cat with badge ain’t, you’re prolly right.  Don’t get agitated- use as few words as you’re able and be polite.

Made a conscious choice to not have kids unless I could meet the following criteria:
1) Be able to provide for them at least as well as my parents did for me. Which wasn’t posh, mind you. My folks were born pre-war and did okay for themselves despite formal education. 
2) Met someone I thought would be a great partner AND a good parent.  That said, being coupled was never a prime priority, so I didn’t invest a lot in hunting; more hoped it would happen organically.  Came close once, but tragedy happens... 
3) I felt confident I was bringing life to a hospitable planet.

Honestly I think Gen Jones' impact was the biggest since that 1940-1945 group that lit up the 1960's with bands. Boomers were responsible for the laid back mellow early 70's, The Eagles, disco, a ton of sappy ""Hey baby"" disposable crap pop in the mid '70's, Arena bands like Styx, Journey, Foreignor, REO Speedwagon, and yes, some good hard rock/heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Boston, Tom Petty, and AC/DC. Also, Iggy Pop and the Stooges and the Ramones cannot and should not be ignored!

Gen Jones contributed true punk/post-punk (all varieties), oldest school rap, hardcore, thrash, college radio, alternative, and everything up to and including some of the grunge. They also contributed the first truly mega pop stars (Madonna, Prince, MJ).

The stain on Gen Jones (to me) is they created much of the 80's hair band music as some of these guys seemed to worship Van Halens first album (that album was right in our wheelhouse) but most couldn't touch it. That being said I guarantee Motley Crue and Def Leppard had a big fanbase with plenty of Gen Xers (be honest). Motley Crue was often sloppy and excessive, but they certainly had their moments.

I have a theory about this but I don't want to get into it now.

While GenX bands were highly influenced by many Gen Jones bands, the one area they killed in the early 90's were the hair bands with the arrival of Nirvana and Pearl Jam.

This group was the creators of all that great music , not the Boomers. Boomers were the consumers. The Beatles, Stones, the Who, Doors, Brian Wilson, Hendrix, Dylan, Kinks et all were from this generation. They had grown up loving that first-generation rock and roll and built on it.

Boomers were those that created Disco (thankfully we in Gen Jones cut Disco off right away, we hated it, and it quickly died near the beginning of the 80's), the mellow singer/songwriter early 70's music like James Taylor and Carly Simon, glam rock like Slade, Sweet, Queen, Kiss, also Fleetwood Mac and The Eagles stuff, arena rock like Styx and Journey, and the harder edged rock that American Gen Jones picked up on before punk....bands like Aerosmith, Van Halen, Rush, AC/DC, and Boston. Van Halen was after punk but so mind-blowingly refreshing at the time they could not be ignored. Those were created by Boomers.

You are right about Stevie Nicks, Debbie Harry, and Dolly Parton, but don't forget the Wilson sisters in Heart and Pat Benatar.

and for music

First all-girl ROCK bands (The Runaways, The Bangles, The Go-gos) I believe, but I could be wrong here, there may have been others.

Punk (including Hardcore, Boomers brought proto-punk though)

New Wave (joint with Boomers, Talking Heads and The Police are  Boomers, Elvis Costello and Gary Numan are Jones for instance)

Post-punk (most all varieties, The Cure, Wire, Joy Division/New Order, The Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Rain Parade, technopop like Duran Duran and Simple Minds)

Alternative and College Radio (REM, Replacements, Husker Du, Cocteau Twins, Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine for example)

Thrash (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer)

Rap (original old-school like Grandmaster Flash, Ice-T, Run DMC, and Public Enemy though Gen X modernized it and brought in some of the best hip-hop artists like Tupac)

I just wanted to make this clear, although Gen X brought their share to the table no doubt. This might not be a popular post to make here but in defense of Gen X much of the music I mentioned has Gen X as the intended audience, so they are often the consumers and play a large part. Basically Gen Jones made music for GenX to consume mostly in the 1980's.

Most of the bands of the latest 80's and the early to mid-90's are Gen X with one important exception: Soundgarden is a Gen Jones band, I think all or most all members were born early 60's. Jeff Ament, great bassist of Mother Love Bone/Pearl Jam is also Gen Jones, but both Nirvana and Pearl Jam are obviously X bands (so what if Vedder was born a week early, he is X) in totality as are the scores of bands and artists that came out early to middle 1990's.

1354,"I would have Millenials as September 1983- August 1995....they are the first generation to graduate high school in a post-9/11 world.

**1983 (9/1/83) -1995 (8/31/95) = Generation Y or Millenials** ( *class of 2002 - class of 2013*, major generation, **12 years**), Millenials are the first major generation to come of age with the PC sales boom and the wild west of the internet in the late 90's. As a result they are the first generation that could realistically use the internet as a medium for mass communication before high school. Millenials are also the first generation to graduate high school *after* the tragic events of 9/11. They grew up or came of age with Star Wars prequels, *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, *Dawsons Creek*, *Friends*, *Futurama*, *Daria*, Netflix, Steam, flip-top phones, Windows 98/2000/XP, CD then DVD Players, AOL chatrooms and My Space, Pokemon, N64, Dreamcast, and the 6th generation consoles (PS2, Gamecube, original XBox). They remember 9/11 clearly.

With internet gaming coming to fruition and with these guys often being hardcore gamers, games as diverse as Diablo 2, Half-Life/Half-Life 2, Counter-strike, Starcraft/Brood War, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, Unreal Tournament 2004, Battlefield 2, as well as console games like original Halo, Metroid Prime, Ocarina of Time, Soul Calibur (1 and 2), Wind Waker, Resident Evil 4, Super Smash Brothers Melee, and GTA: Vice City and/or San Andreas were often on their playlist.

***Fun Fact: with this model ALL (or nearly all, some may have dropped out) Millenials in the U.S. were in 1st-12th grade during the 2001-2002 school year. So basically nearly all Millenials in the U.S. were in school when 9/11 happened!

If people start to recognize us as a separate generation in earnest I will do you a favor and create a separate Gen Jones subreddit and not mention it here anymore.

We are on the cusp between.

We are either a separate Gen Jones (1958-1964) or truly part of Gen X (1961-1981 but I think 1960 belongs here also at least if that's the case).

**1995 (9/1/95 on) -1999 (8/31/99)** **= Generation K (Katniss) or Zillenials** ( *class of 2014 - class* *of 2017*, cusper generation, **4 years**) The generation born around the release of the revolutionary Windows '95 operating system (and the evolutionary Windows '98), these guys spent their childhood glued to the TV set for the latest episode of *Powerpuff Girls, Dexters Laboratory,* or *Johnny Bravo* on Cartoon Network but came of age in late elementary, middle and early highschool with sweeping social and technological changes as a result of Smart Phones, Social Media, and sites like YouTube. Their first phones were often feature (dumb) phones like the Motorola Razr but some in this generation got upgrades to a smart phone by high school. LCD wide-screen HDTV's, Blu-Ray, the Nintendo Wii (with its Wii remote) and Windows 7 were now becoming more commonplace by middle school and this generation was often impacted by TV shows like Lizzie Mcguire, American Idol, and American Horror Story (later on) as well as movies like Avatar and of course The Hunger Games. They share a love of Harry Potter books/movies with late 80's/90's Millenials and a love for Hannah Montana (tend toward female) and Spongebob Squarepants (as kids and teens) with early to middle Gen Z. Most Zillenials were able to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and they constituted the youngest voting block. Like any cusper generation they have an understanding of their border generations to a differing degree and can feel more at home with either one or the other, or just as themselves. They may or may not have memories of 9/11 but not much emotional impact at this age unless the family was directly affected. Best friends Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams (Sansa and Arya Stark from Game of Thrones) are from Generation K, they might make good icons for this generation.

Like the Millenials, members of Gen K were also enjoying games on the 6th generation consoles and eventually the 7th generation consoles (XBox 360, Playstation 3, Nintendo Wii) once they reached middle or high school. In addition to games on the 6th generation consoles (listed in the Millenials description) Zillenials often played 7th generation games like The Mass Effect series (1-3), The Elder Scrolls series (particularly Skyrim), Portal (1 and 2), Grand Theft Auto V, Bioshock, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and the Super Mario Galaxy games.

***Fun Fact: Nearly 100% of all members of Generation K were in high school (U.S., 9th - 12th grade) during the 2013/2014 school year. And nearly 100% of students in high school at that time were part of Generation K according to this model.***",/r/GenX,What generation do you consider those born in the mid-late 90s to be a part of?,HHSquad

I've seen probably at least a hundred concerts in the 1980's.

The 2nd time I saw them in Philly was the best concert I have ever seen by anyone. They pulled out all the stops and played probably at least 25 of their songs, everything from Rescue to The Killing Moon and Silver. During their encore, they said the next song was coming up on their next album....that song was Lips Like Sugar, and it was magnificent live. They were a band crying to be heard by a national audience. I swear every song I requested via shout they played, and often from their great first album Crocodiles. I mean I shouted out ""All That Jazz"" from Crocodiles thinking no way they would play that. And whamo they got right into it, one of my favorite songs by them.

Again, one of the best bands of the 1980's. Girls jumped the stage for McCulluch several times but they played without a hitch.

First time I saw them was great also, they were playing with New Order which is not too shabby especially since NO decided to explore a little of their Joy Division catalogue.

oh and this song and movie are good also ;). I especially like the editing of the video.

High school in the late 1960's is different than high school early 1980's. We were not Boomers, we did not have Vietnam and Woodstock on our minds, but we did actually have finding a job on our mind after the Boomers took the jobs and we were competing with them and the millions of our own group for jobs in a saturated market!

She was just the young fling of the guy that died. Meg was still in college when she got the part. Phoebe Cates, another lovely Gen Joneser had applied for that part, and though she didn't get it, she met future husband Kevin Kline on the set.

I don't understand the hate for Gen Jones,  we were integral to Gen X pop culture growing up and we had a major hand in the grunge movement. We are closely tied together.

....and we were nothing like the Boomers of the 60's (especially those of us born in the 1960's) other than the hair and some love for the late 60's music we remembered as wide-eyed kids, we took the high volume classic rock  and punk of the late 1970's and created alot of new and interesting music in the 1980's (For instance thrash bands like Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer) that was picked up and influential to Gen X bands, not to mention post-punk and alternative.

You don't think any of them had a D.I.Y. attitude? They are all Boomers? What about Grandmaster Flash, Ice-T and Public Enemy, were some of the most important early rappers Boomers also? Jello Biafra and Henry Rollins? 90% of the iconic core Brat Pack? And thats just the American side and the tip of the iceberg. We were into the punk movement (which led to grunge) before Gen X reached middle school. Many of us were doing the things Gen X takes credit for before they were. MTV etc. was right in our wheelhouse just like Gen X. that is a shared experience as is the early part of the golden age of arcade gaming. This isn't a slight on Gen X, I generally like GenXers, I count many as friends.....it just would be nice to get the recognition we deserve. We are a generation between, neither Boomer nor X (ESPECIALLY the 1960-1964 group). you can think those born in the latest 50's are more boomer-like, but other than the birth-rate numbers we in the early 60's were not. Its mostly individual when it comes to 1958-1964, and especially 1960-1964 because Gen Jones is a cusper transitional generation.

I have never been a Boomer and neither have my friends in the '60-'64 born range. that '46-'64 range is held by birth rate only and not by how we are. We aren't X either as I have said over and over, but we are somewhere in between.....which side depends on the individual, not anyones desire to push everyone in there as Boomers because their siblings lean one way or another.

I like that you are partially standing up for Gen Jones also, even if its in the guise of Boomers. Rap and Punk to Jones, Metal largely to Boomers. As much as I rail against our older brothers the Boomers they did their share of good also which is often taken for granted, and people forget the male population had the prospect of being drafted to Vietnam, and not all Boomers were rich enough or connected to avoid that. None of us have been faced with that.

Honestly I think Gen Jones' impact was the biggest since that 1940-1945 group that lit up the 1960's with bands. Boomers were responsible for the laid back mellow early 70's, The Eagles, disco, a ton of sappy ""Hey baby"" disposable crap pop in the mid '70's, Arena bands like Styx, Journey, Foreignor, REO Speedwagon, and yes, some good hard rock/heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Boston, Tom Petty, and AC/DC. Also, Iggy Pop and the Stooges and the Ramones cannot and should not be ignored!

Gen Jones contributed true punk/post-punk (all varieties), oldest school rap, hardcore, thrash, college radio, alternative, and everything up to and including some of the grunge. They also contributed the first truly mega pop stars (Madonna, Prince, MJ).

The stain on Gen Jones (to me) is they created much of the 80's hair band music as some of these guys seemed to worship Van Halens first album (that album was right in our wheelhouse) but most couldn't touch it. That being said I guarantee Motley Crue and Def Leppard had a big fanbase with plenty of Gen Xers (be honest). Motley Crue was often sloppy and excessive, but they certainly had their moments.

We weren't the group specifically called Baby Boomers but we were part of the baby boom, strange as it sounds. We were the 2nd big birth rate group after WW2. We were so big and varied that we were responsible for creating both sides of the coin...  many (but not all!) of the 80's hair band music (Motley Crue, Def Leppard, and uggh Poison and Bon Jovi) and most of the ""antithesis"" bands (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and the lions share of post-punk and 80's alternative) were Gen Jones bands also. I have a theory about this but I don't want to get into it now.

While GenX bands were highly influenced by many Gen Jones bands, the one area they killed in the early 90's were the hair bands with the arrival of Nirvana and Pearl Jam.

1543,"I like your posts but nearly all the great bands and artists of the 60's were born in what I call the Rock and Roll Generation (1940-1945), a war babies cusper generation between Silent and Boomers that came of age with first generation rock and roll like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard.....the ""American Graffitti"" Generation. This group was the creators of all that great music , not the Boomers. Boomers were the consumers. The Beatles, Stones, the Who, Doors, Brian Wilson, Hendrix, Dylan, Kinks et all were from this generation. They had grown up loving that first-generation rock and roll and built on it.

Boomers were those that created Disco (thankfully we in Gen Jones cut Disco off right away, we hated it, and it quickly died near the beginning of the 80's), the mellow singer/songwriter early 70's music like James Taylor and Carly Simon, glam rock like Slade, Sweet, Queen, Kiss, also Fleetwood Mac and The Eagles stuff, arena rock like Styx and Journey, and the harder edged rock that American Gen Jones picked up on before punk....bands like Aerosmith, Van Halen, Rush, AC/DC, and Boston. Van Halen was after punk but so mind-blowingly refreshing at the time they could not be ignored. Those were created by Boomers.

You are right about Stevie Nicks, Debbie Harry, and Dolly Parton, but don't forget the Wilson sisters in Heart and Pat Benatar.

brought the founders of both Amazon and Netflix and the first Black U.S  president (ok technically half black).

and for music

First all-girl ROCK bands (The Runaways, The Bangles, The Go-gos) I believe, but I could be wrong here, there may have been others.

Punk (including Hardcore, Boomers brought proto-punk though)

New Wave (joint with Boomers, Talking Heads and The Police are  Boomers, Elvis Costello and Gary Numan are Jones for instance)

Post-punk (most all varieties, The Cure, Wire, Joy Division/New Order, The Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Rain Parade, technopop like Duran Duran and Simple Minds)

Alternative and College Radio (REM, Replacements, Husker Du, Cocteau Twins, Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine for example)

Thrash (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer)

Rap (original old-school like Grandmaster Flash, Ice-T, Run DMC, and Public Enemy though Gen X modernized it and brought in some of the best hip-hop artists like Tupac)

I just wanted to make this clear, although Gen X brought their share to the table no doubt. This might not be a popular post to make here but in defense of Gen X much of the music I mentioned has Gen X as the intended audience, so they are often the consumers and play a large part. Basically Gen Jones made music for GenX to consume mostly in the 1980's.

Most of the bands of the latest 80's and the early to mid-90's are Gen X with one important exception: Soundgarden is a Gen Jones band, I think all or most all members were born early 60's. Jeff Ament, great bassist of Mother Love Bone/Pearl Jam is also Gen Jones, but both Nirvana and Pearl Jam are obviously X bands (so what if Vedder was born a week early, he is X) in totality as are the scores of bands and artists that came out early to middle 1990's.

As a result they are the first generation that could realistically use the internet as a medium for mass communication before high school. Millenials are also the first generation to graduate high school *after* the tragic events of 9/11.

Their first phones were often feature (dumb) phones like the Motorola Razr but some in this generation got upgrades to a smart phone by high school. LCD wide-screen HDTV's, Blu-Ray, the Nintendo Wii (with its Wii remote) and Windows 7 were now becoming more commonplace by middle school and this generation was often impacted by TV shows like Lizzie Mcguire, American Idol, and American Horror Story (later on) as well as movies like Avatar and of course The Hunger Games. They share a love of Harry Potter books/movies with late 80's/90's Millenials and a love for Hannah Montana (tend toward female) and Spongebob Squarepants (as kids and teens) with early to middle Gen Z. Most Zillenials were able to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and they constituted the youngest voting block. Like any cusper generation they have an understanding of their border generations to a differing degree and can feel more at home with either one or the other, or just as themselves. They may or may not have memories of 9/11 but not much emotional impact at this age unless the family was directly affected. Best friends Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams (Sansa and Arya Stark from Game of Thrones) are from Generation K, they might make good icons for this generation.

Like the Millenials, members of Gen K were also enjoying games on the 6th generation consoles and eventually the 7th generation consoles (XBox 360, Playstation 3, Nintendo Wii) once they reached middle or high school. In addition to games on the 6th generation consoles (listed in the Millenials description) Zillenials often played 7th generation games like The Mass Effect series (1-3), The Elder Scrolls series (particularly Skyrim), Portal (1 and 2), Grand Theft Auto V, Bioshock, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and the Super Mario Galaxy games.

***Fun Fact: Nearly 100% of all members of Generation K were in high school (U.S., 9th - 12th grade) during the 2013/2014 school year.

I've seen probably at least a hundred concerts in the 1980's.

The 2nd time I saw them in Philly was the best concert I have ever seen by anyone. They pulled out all the stops and played probably at least 25 of their songs, everything from Rescue to The Killing Moon and Silver. During their encore, they said the next song was coming up on their next album....that song was Lips Like Sugar, and it was magnificent live. They were a band crying to be heard by a national audience. I swear every song I requested via shout they played, and often from their great first album Crocodiles. I mean I shouted out ""All That Jazz"" from Crocodiles thinking no way they would play that. And whamo they got right into it, one of my favorite songs by them.

Again, one of the best bands of the 1980's. Girls jumped the stage for McCulluch several times but they played without a hitch.

First time I saw them was great also, they were playing with New Order which is not too shabby especially since NO decided to explore a little of their Joy Division catalogue.

oh and this song and movie are good also ;). I especially like the editing of the video.

High school in the late 1960's is different than high school early 1980's. We were not Boomers, we did not have Vietnam and Woodstock on our minds, but we did actually have finding a job on our mind after the Boomers took the jobs and we were competing with them and the millions of our own group for jobs in a saturated market! No wonder we partied so hard in high school. Like the red-head in Dazed and Confused said, the 70's sucked, but we would be in our 20's in the 80's and it might turn out to be good ....and indeed most of us ended up doing well despite the 80's  recessions in our path.",/r/GenX,"If The Breakfast Club captures Gen X in our teen years and Reality Bites in our 20s, what films would you say represent Gen X in our 30s-(early)50s?",HHSquad

Boomers were The Big Chill, and I couldn't get into that one either. If I were a Boomer I suppose that should have been an easy one to get into, but it didn't speak to me. Only interesting thing to me in that movie was Meg Tilly......ooooh da sexy! In fact Meg Tilly was the only Gen Jonser in that movie, the others were all Boomers. She was just the young fling of the guy that died. Meg was still in college when she got the part. Phoebe Cates, another lovely Gen Joneser had applied for that part, and though she didn't get it, she met future husband Kevin Kline on the set.

I don't understand the hate for Gen Jones,  we were integral to Gen X pop culture growing up and we had a major hand in the grunge movement. We are closely tied together.

....and we were nothing like the Boomers of the 60's (especially those of us born in the 1960's) other than the hair and some love for the late 60's music we remembered as wide-eyed kids, we took the high volume classic rock  and punk of the late 1970's and created alot of new and interesting music in the 1980's (For instance thrash bands like Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer) that was picked up and influential to Gen X bands, not to mention post-punk and alternative.

This places Millenials as the first generation to graduate high school post 9/11 and the last Millenials born around the time of Windows '95.

By coincidence there's nothing better than the number 12 anyways, you can divide the generation nicely still further in 3 or 4 for those so inclined.

You don't think any of them had a D.I.Y. attitude? They are all Boomers? What about Grandmaster Flash, Ice-T and Public Enemy, were some of the most important early rappers Boomers also? Jello Biafra and Henry Rollins? 90% of the iconic core Brat Pack? And thats just the American side and the tip of the iceberg. We were into the punk movement (which led to grunge) before Gen X reached middle school. Many of us were doing the things Gen X takes credit for before they were. MTV etc. was right in our wheelhouse just like Gen X. that is a shared experience as is the early part of the golden age of arcade gaming. This isn't a slight on Gen X, I generally like GenXers, I count many as friends.....it just would be nice to get the recognition we deserve. We are a generation between, neither Boomer nor X (ESPECIALLY the 1960-1964 group). you can think those born in the latest 50's are more boomer-like, but other than the birth-rate numbers we in the early 60's were not. Its mostly individual when it comes to 1958-1964, and especially 1960-1964 because Gen Jones is a cusper transitional generation. But just like the Oregon Trail Generation on the other side it is real.

Your 2nd paragraph makes no sense, while I personally would like to see many of the ideas Sanders talks about come to fruition, we know realistically it isn't going to happen AT THIS TIME. How are those ideas going to pass through Congress at this time? And Sanders people can't even be bothered to vote for him against Biden, so how is he going to beat the ""Orange Overlord""? It doesn't look like Trump supporters are going to budge at all. Be open-minded about things. But alas I don't want to stain this subreddit with politics.

I have never been a Boomer and neither have my friends in the '60-'64 born range. that '46-'64 range is held by birth rate only and not by how we are. We aren't X either as I have said over and over, but we are somewhere in between.....which side depends on the individual, not anyones desire to push everyone in there as Boomers because their siblings lean one way or another.

Imagine being lumped in with this bunch of self-serving group when the only major politician we contributed was President Obama.

When he authorized the temporary program he also announced that he would veto any legislation that would allow public health officials to do any kind of needle exchanges in the future, so the next epidemic would have to infect tons of people before any future governor would be able to mount a response.

I laid down in the bug-infested muddy garden for about an hour. Managed to catch only one of the kittens this way (the others were too scared of humans to let me near), and I took care of the little guy and found him a good home. The rest of his family was killed.

Everyone in the building was upset, but it didn't matter. One Chinese woman yelled loudly at the building management, and he basically said that if he saw her feeding any other cats again he would throw her stuff out on the street.

Yup, many Chinese people really don't have any empathy for animals.

I triple washed everything, using both soap and a special vegetable disinfectant wash imported from Australia.  Didn't make a bloody difference.

It's not just the tainted meat, wild animals, etc. In China, chickens and other animals roam freely around the fields pooping on all the crops and no one cares and nothing is ever tested and there is no quality control.

Most of my Chinese friends were constantly taking some kind of herbal remedy for diarrhea. It was a crazy place.

I've been back in the U.S. for over a year now and I still do a happy dance every time the fruits and vegetables don't make me sick. Also I've been eating mountains of fruits and vegetables since I got back. Because I can :-)

As for going into other people’s homes - yeah that’s a thing too. My neighbors would just show up and not leave, even when asked directly to get the eff out. Conversely, they’d leave their doors open all day long and the few times I had to go to see them they didn’t seem to mind me just waltzing through the open door (and trying not to trip on all their random crap and trash strewn everywhere).  Seriously, they had cabinets and drawers but never seemed to put things in them...

The one thing I never understood was the no making beds thing. Rich or poor, Chinese people never made their beds. The rich ones might put the blankets away each morning so the mattress with just the fitted sheet would be there, but that was as close to a made bed as I ever saw.

1766,"I realize this is completely out of left field, but I've long held onto the notion that one of the over-arching themes of the show is that God is a woman. The constant eggs are literal ""Easter eggs"" pointing viewers in this direction, as Easter was a fertility festival celebrating various female Goddesses of fertility (which one depended on where you were in the world), before it got co-opted by Christianity.

In ""She was killed by Space Junk,"" you could easily interpret the joke to mean that God is a woman. There are two ways to do this:

1. In the joke, God is killed by the brick, which could be ""space junk"". So the God in the joke is a woman. Yes, Laurie uses the ""he"" pronoun, but she might not realize the truth of this yet, and calling God ""him"" is the most conventional way to refer to divinity in our society.
2. In the joke, after all of the heroes \*and\* God is killed, only the girl is left. Presumably she takes God's place, or (most likely) she was there before him so she was always a Goddess - always present and more powerful than him, he just didn't notice her before it was too late. This interpretation also foreshadows the possibility that Dr. Manhattan knows that God is a woman, and that's why he tells Angela to ""watch the eggs"".

Lady Trieu has a female-only space where we have only seen one man enter - Will Reeves. And when he is in that space, he is able to walk, which points to special powers of regeneration only possible in a place of feminine power.

There are many other examples of eggs linking to fertility - the Clark family. Will eating eggs as Angela learns more about her family, etc.

My favorite mention of eggs is when Dr. Manhattan points out that eggs and chickens must appear at the same time because one cannot come before the other, which is another way to say that you can't have a God without a Goddess. Or that you can't have fertility without a mother. Either way,  God (or at least one of them), is a woman.

1798,"First of all, I'm a marijuana addict. A huge one. I can't speak to your parents' use but I can say for sure that anyone raised by an addict is going to have issues. The thing is, when you're in active addiction, which for me was smoking as much as 1/4 oz \*a day\*, you lie to yourself that you're a better parent when you're high, you're more patient, more loving, etc. 

Also, you have (what the 12-steppers call), the ""Fantasy of Functionality"". I thought I was doing fine as a parent until I got sober. Now I'm starting to realize how much of a ""parent"" my kid has had to be for me these last few years, and its just heartbreaking to see how much I've made her grow up so fast, and how her ""parenting"" of me has caused her to fall behind her peers in a lot of areas, but especially socially/emotionally. She also has severe panic disorder, which yes I'm sure she was born with, but while I was in active addiction I chose a pretty shitty therapist for her who probably made her panic disorder worse, and it goes on and on...  

The bottom line is that when I was in active addiction, marijuana was the most important thing in my life. Period. Now that I'm sober, my daughter is the most important thing in my life, and I pray to the Goddess every day that I never smoke again, because I lost so much time with her... and I'll never be able to get it back.

It will not be easy to stay away from weed as this little baby will do nothing but change for the next three-plus decades. But stay strong! One of my biggest regrets as a parent is how much I smoked. Even if the kid doesn't know that you smoke (mine didn't), weed will seriously impact your ability to be a good parent. Take it from someone who wishes that they could turn back the clock and be sober for so... freaking... much. I'm now 43 days sober and doing my best to fix the damage I did to my relationship with my kid. Thank the goddess her other parent doesn't smoke/drink/do drugs or I can't imagine what an absolute mess she'd be right now (and to be fair, she's not where she should be at her age, mostly due to my weed use).

Their friends walked through our yard and everyone parked their vehicles in the center of the circle so getting in and out of our home was a nightmare.

I couldn’t do dick about any of it, either. It was a small town and the cops were friends with all of these guys. I eventually sold the house at a significant financial loss because no one else wanted to move in and I couldn’t take it anymore.

- Baked/roasted sweet potatoes with cinnamon. Usually, I dice some sweet potatoes and steam them for a bit. Then, I’ll coat them lightly with some oil (either avocado or extra virgin olive oil; avocado imparts the least flavor and has a higher smoke point, but imo, either works). Sprinkle/coat with cinnamon and bake or roast in the oven. (I don’t have time/temp guidance; for me, these are pretty hard to screw up). Add salt to taste if desired.


- Tofu scramble — I would just google, there are a ton of recipes out there. If you belong to a Costco, they sell a 4-pack of organic tofu for @ $5. You could experiment with a couple of recipes before the actual brunch — it won’t be wasted effort, because the recipes often translate well to egg dishes (I never would have thought to sprinkle curry powder on my eggs if it weren’t for tofu scramble).


- Avocado toast, like someone mentioned above. Or maybe homemade guacamole with toast squares.


- A box of vegan granola and/or a box of vegan unsweetened muesli on standby, with some unsweetened almond milk. (People can always add sugar, but they can’t take it away.)


-  Desert — vegan sweet potato pie or vegan bean pie. You will have to make enough for everyone, though, because they are both delicious and addictive! Sorry, no particular recipes to recommend. My neighborhood co-op sells both, and I used to buy one once a week, until I acknowledged that my ass would keep expanding if I kept doing so.


- r/PlantBasedDiet may have some good ideas if you search for breakfast or brunch.


- Look for the “vegan” label on anything you buy pre-packaged (eg, my favorite muesli, which I always assumed was vegan, states that it “may contain traces of milk.”)

Total infections is following a [logistic curve](http://www.sci.wsu.edu/math/faculty/hudelson/logisticlesson.html), which starts out looking like an exponential and continues until it starts to hit limits (definitely can't go past the total population!).  Total infections isn't known, but we can look at known cases.

If we pretend it _is_ an exponential function, then see when that would mean the entire population has been infected, then we can set an upper bound on how late it could fall away from matching an exponential curve.

If you take a look at [any charts](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/), you can see that the US has a nearly-flat line in log space (go to ""Total Coronavirus Cases in the United States"", click ""logarithmic""), so the exponential growth shape is pretty stable.  Let's use that.

March 1st we had 75 known cases, on the 22nd (a 21-day span) it was 33546.  We'll take a US population of 330,479,172.

exp(ln(cases₂/cases₁)/days) = exp(ln(33546/75)/21) = 1.337…, so we have 33.7% day-over-day growth.

ln(2)/1.337… = 2.385…, so the known cases double every 2.385 days.

ln(population/cases₁)/1.337… = ln(330479172/75)/1.337… = 52.64…, so we know it can't stay on an exponential trajectory in the US past 53 days (April 23).  **That does NOT mean that the virus will be gone by then, just that the trajectory of infection will level off to something obviously different by the current seeming exponential by then.**

The closer we get to that date, the closer we have come to complete ineffectiveness at controlling it.

I know people cant just buy new rides but my point being even though I had 10500 max tow even half that wasnt enjoyable so at minimum see if you can test pull and find some decent incline.

Distressed jeans would probably make it more grunge, but my workplace, while casual, isn't quite *that* casual. From there's just down to jewelry choices.

If anything, this is the *opposite* of that. This is *promotion* of the literature in question, this is highlighting it and presenting it to the community. You don't suppress literature by reading it aloud publicly.

I think you could make an argument that this event might be counterproductive in the long run, or might be ""shaming"" to readers who like these books unironically. I personally would disagree with that position, but I think you could make the case. But to call it censorship is cringey. Words have meanings, and this is ridiculously outside the definition of the word being used here. 

Also, as an aside, I read the title ""Bad Romance"" as an obsolete reference to the Lady Gaga song (very on-brand for librarians) rather than a value judgment. I could easily be wrong, but that's how I read it.

(This is a particularly white part of the northeast, so her life here is... yeah.)

It's hard to square this -- it's a worthy goal, it's part of our official goals (so it's necessary to document it), and we need to be thinking in these terms to make our library/campus more welcoming to POC students.

3246,"Okay, well, that's under the library science umbrella too, now that you mention it. Mostly those people are called archivists, but they still generally get an MLS or MLIS, which is the same degree that librarians get. They may do some specialist training/education as well.

My best recommendation for a high school student thinking about heading down this road: see if you can volunteer for your local public library, or another library in your area. There are potentially a lot of things you could do, and it will give you a chance to start seeing what libraries are really like, and if you actually enjoy the work. Or if you're heading off to college, see if you can get a student job at the college/university library. If you tell them you're interested in librarianship as a career, that will almost certainly get your foot in the door. It won't be glamorous, but you'll get to see what the work is really like. 

Good luck to you!",/r/GenX,Library science as a career,nobody_you_know
3247,"I mean... do you want to be a librarian? Because a career in library science basically equals being a librarian. There are lots of ways to be a librarian, and most librarians can say lots of great things about the work they do. But yeah, it's pretty much librarians all the way down.  

I suppose you could also be a professor of library/information science, but becoming a professor of anything is not recommended. It's a very long, expensive road with an incredibly low chance of paying off. Even becoming a professional librarian will almost always require a master's degree. Bachelor's degrees  in LIS are generally not recommended, unless you're really only thinking about lower-ranking positions in the library. Even then, the BA isn't really strictly necessary for that kind of job.

The minor in psych sounds fine, though, if that sounds enjoyable to you. And if you're really thinking about Information Science (which is related to Library Science, but different), then that's a whole other conversation.",/r/GenX,Library science as a career,nobody_you_know
3248,"1) You don't have to decide what kind of librarian you want to be yet. I geared my course work to digital librarianship, then got my first job in a 9-12 boarding school, and now I'm an academic librarian at a small, private undergrad college. Focus on the skills that interest you/your future employers need, and you'll find your place in time. 

2) Librarianship is competitive, but not any more so than any other desirable professional career. Archives is probably somewhat more competitive, if only because there are fewer positions, but I've known several people who successfully became archivists. 

3) The name of the school on your diploma has literally zero meaning. Look for an ALA-accredited program that fits your needs the best (including your financial needs) and covers the content that you're most interested in, and you're good to go. 

Other random tips: your professional career starts on the first day of library school; be a good person to work with, and it'll serve you well after graduation. Do as much practical, in-the-trenches library work as you possibly can while you're in school, because the opportunities are much easier to come by as a student, and practical experience trumps coursework every time. Find a skill set that you can be especially good at -- technology, or instruction, or working with some marginalized group -- to ""value add"" to your MLIS, so you stand out better against the crowd.

3253,"I just went on this hunt, and tried on more than a dozen plain white shirts in the process. Here's where I ended up:

My favorite is Everlane's [Linen Relaxed Shirt](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-relaxed-linen-shirt-white?collection=womens-tops). Given that it's linen it's a little bit slouchy, and pretty casual. It's minimally see-through, which is apparently almost impossible to find in women's white shirts these days. 

I also tried (and really liked) their [Women's Japanese Oxford Shirt](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-japanese-oxford-shirt-white?collection=womens-tops). It's a little boxy for my taste, so I'm contemplating sending it back, but I'm going to take a few more days to play with it first. It's a nice, well-constructed shirt, and 0% transparent. 

I also ended up getting Banana Republic's [Riley Tailored-Fit Shirt](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=493544012&cid=1150106&pcid=5037&vid=1&grid=pds_28_412_1#pdp-page-content), which is a bit crisper, and (as it says on the tin) more tailored. Also not too transparent, though... a little bit. This is apparently not currently available in white, but I've got one, so I know it's available at least sometimes. I like this one because it was available in a Tall, and it works pretty well over my hips, boobs, and broad shoulders without binding or gapping anywhere. It's not my holy grail white shirt, but it's pretty decent. 

The main things I learned through this process: 

Most women's white shirts are utterly see-through. I tried on some that -- even with a skin-tone bra and tank top underneath -- left me feeling quite exposed. Also, the details make a surprisingly big difference. I went looking for one white shirt, and ended up with at least two (maybe three) because they each perform a slightly different function. This is really my first time doing this, so I'm willing to collect a few good examples and wear them for a while to figure out what's going to work for me the best.",/r/GenX,"Tell me your favorite classic white button-down shirt.

In the end, I just quit, and focused on getting a haircut that made my grey look nice rather than frumpy. I'd been wearing a sort of non-committal shoulder-length bob for years, and ultimately I veered toward a floppy pixie with a pretty hard undercut.

I like kids pretty much the same way I like all people. Some of them are really cool, some of them really suck, and most of them I'm just indifferent to. I also know that most people aspire to parenthood, and the birth of a child is an occasion for joy. I get it, I'm down with all of it. I'm happy for them in that they get to do something that they really want to do. But as a childfree-by-choice, middle-aged woman, there's also a little part of me that feels... *""aw man, you too?""* Most recently I felt this with a couple I'm friends with, but don't see often anymore (not related to the birth of their daughter.) I even knew that they really wanted to have a baby! It's not like they misrepresented anything, or that I didn't know this was in the plan. And I think their daughter is super cute, and I do often (though not universally) enjoy seeing their Facebook posts about her, or about being parents, etc. But still that little disappointment was there, like I had hoped for more from them. It's irrational, but it's there. 

I have a cousin who, with his wife, had seemed like they were headed down the childfree, DINK path -- they traveled a lot, did cool things, etc. But nope, now there's a baby.

3281,"There's a good deal of overlap between Library Science and Information Science, but no, IS is not the ""next stage"" of LS.

IS  may also deal with them, but the needs of any user (except for maybe a corporate patron) isn't necessarily, or even probably, of any relevance. 

And no, you shouldn't get a PhD in library science for this. The only reason you should ever consider a PhD in LS is because you want to become a professor of librarianship.

3282,"I'm an academic librarian at a small, private liberal arts college, undergrad only. My area of professional specialization is film and video, and teaching. I don't actually have a second master's, but I do have a rough equivalent. 

1) The only times I would call my job ""stressful"" is when multiple projects are piling up all at once. And the beginning of each academic term can be a little bit harried, more because of faculty demands than because of students. But compared to jobs I worked prior to becoming a librarian, I'd be hard-pressed to ever consider my current job stressful. This could easily be because of the small, rather isolated nature of the college where I work. 

2) It varies. I might have a shift at the research desk, I might have a class session to prep or to teach, I might have a student or faculty research consultation. There are frequent, though not constant, meetings. The rest of my time is spent working on projects. Right now I'm trying to finish off a video tutorial, prepping a last couple of class sessions for the term, and working on a massive deselection project. I'm also taking a course in instructional design toward a post-grad certificate, and I can spend some work time on that. 

3) Mostly, yes. We do all have some evening and Sunday shifts to work as well -- we all share them between us -- but I'm done with those for this term. We get a good bit of leeway on when we arrive and leave; general hours are 8:30 AM - 5 PM, but it's not unusual for people to show up a bit late or leave a bit early, or even take a long lunch. We trust each other to be there when needed, to pull our own weight, and to ""comp"" any hours we take off during the day. But this is probably an unusually hands-off institution in that regard.

4) Nope, not necessarily. If classes are in session and students are on campus, the library is open and we're working unless we take CTO for that day. We do get thanksgiving, and the bit between christmas and new years, because that's the one time of the year when the campus closes completely. But we routinely work easter, independence day, most bank/mail holidays, etc. On the other hand, we get quite generous CTO allowances, so if you really want a holiday off, you can generally get it without a problem. 

5) I mean, the best thing is when a student brings you a really interesting question, and you work together to devise a strategy through it. I do also enjoy teaching classes, although I usually dread them a bit in anticipation. One of those things where I don't want to do it beforehand, but enjoy the process once I'm in it, and am glad I did it afterward. 

6) The biggest obstacle will always be the administration. They say they care about the library, but they don't, or not in any way that helps us. Also, 95% of the time, we have to do our primary jobs (teaching and supporting the academic mission of the institution) under constraints that make it essentially impossible to actually do really well.

* It may be that these jobs are open because nobody wants to have to do all this stuff. But it makes a perfect dues-paying job for a new MLS graduate, a place where you can learn a ton, prove what you can do, and get some practical experience on your resume for what's next. 
* Even if you get it totally wrong, it probably won't be any worse than it is now. 
* Personally, I think you should take as much practical experience (whether paid, volunteer, intern, practicum, whatever) as you can get, because a library science degree with no practical experience behind it will put you *way* behind when the time comes to go for the jobs you really want.

The rest is a dramatization, based partly on what was suspected to have happened to them, and partly fictionalized based on Inuit mythology and dramatic license. 

A major theory about what happened in the months that they were frozen in the ice was that the canned food they were eating was packaged improperly and was slowly inducing lead poisoning in the entire crew. Lead poisoning *can* lead to hallucinations/mental decay, which is one read on the Tuunbaq/pervasive murdery-ness of the crew... it wasn't actually happening, but it was how the crew, with their lead-addled brains, were perceiving the situation. But the show, and the novel on which it was based, were both ambiguous on this point. 

I believe more recent findings suggest that the crew wasn't really suffering from acute lead poisoning, but rather that they probably just got sick and starved/froze to death. We can't really know for sure, though. 

The remains of both ships have been found at this point, along with the remains of a few crew members. Oh, and nobody knows whether Crozier moved in with the Inuits -- seems doubtful -- but I think that was just a way to give the story a satisfying ending.

I don't know much about the Denver program itself, but locations share many instructors, and Emporia is adequate, if you're willing to put more into it than you're expected to.

All natural animal fibers are going to be pretty warm; the difference is more about how *soft* the fiber is. Any sheep's wool is warm, but it can be scratchy (and allergenic for some people.) Merino wool (which is a sheep's wool from merino breed sheep) is softer, and less likely to cause itchy rashes. Alpaca is softer still, and warmer, and all but completely hypoallergenic. Fibers like angora, mohair, and camel can be incredibly soft and warm, but they're generally difficult to harvest and so they're generally prohibitively expensive (and in some cases, can be quite delicate and tricky to care for.) 

Also worth noting that, generally speaking, the softer a fiber is, the more inclined it will be to pill. It's a trade-off. 

Cashmere is sort of the happy balance for luxury natural fibers -- quite warm, very soft, rather expensive but not unreachably so. Merino is the common man's equivalent. In either case, the more wool a garment has, the warmer it will likely be; if that wool is mostly merino, it will be soft as well; if it has some cashmere, it will be softer still. It just kind of depends on your ideal balance of warmth/softness/durability/expense. 

Generally speaking, in real winter climates, the more animal fiber an sweater contains, the better it will be at keeping you warm and comfortable. Synthetic yarns just don't do as good a job.

Cons:

* the faculty you work with can have an air of entitlement roughly equivalent to that of a Russian oligarch

So, I'm actually looking at moving back to Texas, from Vermont. Specifically, I'm looking at Houston... Vermont is lovely, and I understand why people love it, but it's just not for me. I need tacos, and queso, and people who are different from the universal WASP profile that Vermont specializes in. I need modern conveniences and things going on, and a place where I can afford to buy a house eventually. I need a place where I can possibly bring my mother when she gets old(er). I would like to never shovel snow again. Basically, I want the opposite of Vermont.

I frequently wonder if I'm crazy for considering it, and I understand all that I'd be dealing with (I spent my childhood in Texas, and much of my life in the South), and sometimes I think about the politics/religion and start having doubts.

Fox news lies about most of the stories I see on the CBC, or any other news service. In fact, Fox is technically considered an ""entertainment"" channel. I've never heard a news slant as biased as Fox.

I've been paying attention to politics since I was in my teens in the 80’s. The Republicans started pandering to the religious right as tactical move to get more voters. They did this by making abortion a political wedge issue instead of a health decision made by a doctor and patient. 

Give money to rich people, and they put it in foreign banks and give it to their children when they die.

Give money to ""the people"" and they will sure as hell spend it. This is better for the economy.

If the Republicans win this election, they will likely get two Supreme Court judges on the bench, and that will slant your society to the right for a generation, despite who wins the presidency.
